          (INTO THE FUTURE)

The sun was shining brightly as the new students of Nightshade Wonderland gathered in the courtyard. Lilith, a senior with striking features and an enchanting smile, stood before them.

"You are all welcomed to our school," Lilith said, her voice warm and inviting. "I'm sure you're going to love it here."

The new students exchanged excited glances, their eyes sparkling with anticipation. One of them, a timid-looking girl with curly brown hair, raised her hand.

"What should we expect from here?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lilith's smile broadened. "A lot of fun and trouble," she said, her eyes glinting with mischief. "Let's just say some of you will have fun, and some will be...unlucky."

The new students laughed nervously, unsure what to make of Lilith's enigmatic warning.

Arachne, a petite girl with butterfly flying around her, raised her hand next. 

"Can you tell us the history of the school?" she asked.

Lilith nodded, a faraway look in her eyes. "Nightshade Wonderland was founded thousands of years ago," she began. "It was founded by Master Nox, a powerful sorcerer who sought to create a haven for magical beings."

As Lilith spoke, the air around her began to shimmer and shine. The new students gasped in wonder as images began to appear in the air, illustrating Lilith's words.

They saw Master Nox, a tall, imposing figure with piercing eyes, standing before a grand, sprawling castle. They saw his son, a young man with a mischievous grin, taking over the school after Master Nox's death.

And they saw Mistress Morwen, a stately woman with long, flowing hair, taking the reins after Master Darko's passing.

"I hear Mistress Morwen has two daughters," Arachne said, her eyes sparkling with interest.

Lilith's smile faltered for a moment, before she regained her composure. 

"Yes, that's true," she said.

 "Maledicta and Benedicta. I would really advise you all to stay away from the first one...if you love your life." She warned.

The new students exchanged nervous glances, unsure what to make of Lilith's warning.

But before they could ask any more questions, a commotion broke out at the edge of the courtyard, students were running away, their faces pale and frightened.

"What's going on?" one of the new students asked, alarm rising in her voice.

Lilith's eyes flicked towards the disturbance, before she turned back to the new students. 

"Just hide for now," she said, her voice low and urgent.

The new students didn't need to be told twice. They scattered, hiding behind nearby statues or darting into the nearby buildings.

Arachne stood frozen, unsure what to do. But before she could move, Lilith grabbed her arm and pulled her into a nearby alcove.

"Don't speak," Lilith whispered, her eyes fixed on something across the courtyard. "Just watch."

Arachne peeked around the edge of the alcove, her heart pounding in her chest. And then she saw her.

Maledicta, Mistress Morwen's daughter, was walking across the courtyard, her eyes fixed on some point in the distance, her white hair reaching her waist. Her aura was like nothing Arachne had ever seen before - cold, chilling, and utterly terrifying.

People were running away from her, their faces pale and frightened. And Arachne could see why. Maledicta's very presence seemed to draw the light out of the air, leaving only darkness and shadow in her wake.

"That's Maledicta," Lilith whispered, her voice barely audible. "The daughter of Mistress Morwen. She's cursed, and a glare from her can send you to the ground. And that dark shadow looming around her...that's doom."

Arachne felt a shiver run down her spine as she watched Maledicta walk away. She couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity for the girl, who seemed so alone and isolated.

"I don't think she's that bad, though," Arachne said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lilith raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in her eyes. 

"You will get your answer soon," she said, before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

Arachne watched her go, before turning back to gaze across the courtyard. Maledicta was still walking away, her dark shadow looming behind her like a specter of doom.
.

.

The seniors gathered in their meeting room, each one radiating impatience as they waited for the last member to arrive. The room was dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles to illuminate the space.

Mistress Morwen swept into the room, her long, flowing hair billowing behind her. 

"She's still not here yet?" she asked, her voice tinged with annoyance.

Benedicta, Maledicta's twin sister, smiled placatingly. 

"Let's just wait a little bit longer, Mother." She said.

"We can do the mission without her, right?" Belladonna said, rolling her eyes. 

"I mean, it's not like she's indispensable or anything." She added, she is a very powerful princess.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment, before she regained her composure.

 "I'm sure Maledicta will be here soon," she said.

Just then, the door burst open and Maledicta strode in, her eyes flashing with annoyance. 

"Why was I called here?" she demanded, her voice icy.

Belladonna rolled her eyes again, her expression disdainful. "Oh, great. The queen of darkness has deigned to join us."

Maledicta's gaze flicked to Belladonna, her eyes narrowing. But she said nothing, instead turning to her mother. 

"What's this about?" She demanded.

 "Epusa, the demoness, is up to no good. I've just received word that she's sneaking into the future, and that's not good at all. We have to stop her before she can carry out her plans." Mistress Morwen said.

"Open the portal. Let me go." Maledicta said blankly.

Benedicta stepped forward, her eyes shining with concern. "Sister, you can't go alone. I could go with you—"

 I don't need you."Maledicta cut her off coldly. 

The room fell silent, the only sound the soft crackling of the candles. Mistress Morwen's eyes flicked to Maledicta, a hint of sadness in her expression.

But then she nodded and started chanting some words.

As the portal swirled to life, Maledicta stepped forward, her eyes fixed on the shimmering gateway. But just as she was about to step through, a hand reached out and grabbed her arm.

"Let me go with you," Cassius, the alpha prince, said, his eyes locked on Maledicta's.

 "It could be dangerous in there." He added gently, everyone knows he has crush on her and that is the main reason Belladonna hate Maledicta so much.

Maledicta's gaze flicked to Cassius hand, her eyes narrowing. And then, in a movement so swift it was almost imperceptible, she glared at him.

Cassius flew backward, slamming into the wall with a sickening thud. The room erupted into chaos as the other seniors rushed to his side, helping him to his feet.

Belladonna's face was twisted with anger.

 "Witch!" she spat, striding towards Maledicta.

But Maledicta was already gone, stepping through the portal, the portal swirled shut behind her, leaving the others to stare at each other in shock.

"Well, that was fun," Belladonna said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "I'm so glad we got to see Maledicta's charming personality in action."

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger. "That's not fair, Belladonna. Maledicta's just trying to protect herself."

But Belladonna just laughed. "Protect herself? From what? Cassius's overwhelming charm?" She asked.

    “I am okay guys, so please stop” Cassius said and left.

The rooftop was dimly lit, the only sound the distant hum of the city below. A group of demons surrounded one of their own, who held a shiny stone aloft. He chanted in a low, raspy voice, and the stone began to glow with an otherworldly light.

As he raised the stone to throw it into the sky, a figure suddenly appeared on the rooftop. Maledicta's eyes blazed with fury as she took in the scene before her.

The stone shattered into a thousand pieces as Maledicta's presence washed over it. The demons surrounding the stone's holder let out a collective shriek as they began to burn, their bodies dissolving into ash as they stumbled and fell.

The demon who had held the stone turned to face Maledicta, his eyes wide with fear. 

"Ma...le...dic...ta," he stammered, his voice trembling.

Maledicta supersped towards him, her movements a blur as she grabbed his neck and slammed him against the rooftop. 

"Why did your queen send you here?" she demanded, her voice cold and deadly.

The demon struggled to speak, his words cut short as Maledicta slammed him against the wall. The wall cracked and splintered, crumbling into dust as the demon's eyes went wide with terror.

"I want a straight answer," Maledicta growled, her grip on the demon's neck tightening.

"I-I was just following Her Highness's orders," the demon stammered.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed. "That's not an answer," she spat, her fist flying towards the demon's face.

Six of his teeth flew out as Maledicta's punch connected, the demon's eyes streaming with tears as he stumbled backwards.

Maledicta advanced on him, her eyes blazing with fury. 

"You're going to tell me what I want to know," she snarled.

But before she could strike again, the demon suddenly stabbed her in the neck with a hidden blade. Maledicta's eyes widened in shock as she stumbled backwards, her strength faltering. The demon laugh seeing how she is struggling to stand.

     “You can't do anything, you are weak now, the dagger was coated with Blackthorn juice (a poisonous plant which makes someone weak for six to seven hours) I will kill you, so you won't have chance to return” he said.

The demon took advantage of her weakness, and stab her in the chest and then kick her hard. Maledicta flew off the rooftop, her body crashing onto a moving car below.

The car screeched to a halt as the driver leapt out, his eyes wide with horror as he took in Maledicta's bloodied form.

"Oh no, not my boss's car!" he exclaimed, rushing towards Maledicta.

Maledicta's eyes flickered open, her gaze locking onto the stranger's face. She tried to speak, but her voice was barely a whisper.

The stranger's eyes widened in alarm as he took in Maledicta's injuries.

 "Miss, are you okay?" he asked, his voice trembling with concern.

Maledicta's gaze drifted away, her eyes glazing over as she lost consciousness. The stranger's face fell, his eyes filling with worry as he frantically dialed for help.

As he waited for the ambulance to arrive, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had just stumbled into something much bigger than himself.
.

Kaiden paced anxiously outside the hospital room, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios. He had found her lying on the cat, bleeding profusely, and his heart had almost stopped. Who was she? And what had happened to her?

The doctor emerged from the room, a reassuring smile on his face.

 "How is she, doctor?" Kaiden asked worriedly.

"Nothing is wrong, she's just stressed," the doctor said, his expression calm.

Kaiden's eyes narrowed. "What about the deep wound and blood?" he asked.

The doctor's smile faltered for a moment.

 "What are you talking about? She has nothing on her body. She's awake now, you can take her home." He said.

Kaiden's confusion deepened. Hadn't he seen the blood?.

He pushed aside his doubts and entered the hospital room. The girl was sitting on the bed, staring blankly into space. Her eyes were sunken, her skin pale.

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked, trying to keep his voice gentle.

She didn't respond. Kaiden's concern grew. He grabbed her hand, trying to rouse her.

 "Hey, can you hear me?"She didn't react. Kaiden's heart sank. Was she okay? Really?

He helped her out of the hospital, his mind racing with questions. Who was she? What had happened to her? And why wasn't she responding?

As they walked to the car, Kaiden tried to ask her more questions.

 "Where are you coming from? How did you fall on my car?"

She still didn't respond. Kaiden's frustration grew. Was she deaf and dumb?

He helped her into the car, trying to be patient. Maybe she was just traumatized. Maybe she needed time.

As they drove to Kaiden's apartment, the silence between them grew thicker. Kaiden tried to make small talk, but she didn't respond.

When they arrived at the apartment, Kaiden helped her inside.

 "Are you hungry? Are you feeling sick?" he asked, trying to gauge her condition.

She didn't respond. Kaiden's concern deepened. He led her to the couch, where she collapsed, closing her eyes.

"She must still be tired," Kaiden muttered, trying to reassure himself.

Just then, his phone dinged. Kaiden's heart sank as he read the text from his boss. "Return my car, you're fired."

Kaiden's hand shook as he read the text. He had forgotten about his boss's daughter's birthday surprise, he was supposed to deliver present to her but he was distracted by the accident.

He immediately ran out of the apartment, leaving the mysterious girl behind. As he rushed to return the car.
.
.
.
.

Kaiden trudged through the door, his shoulders slumped in defeat. He had just lost his job, and with it, his only means of paying off the loan sharks who had been hounding him for months.

His father's disappearance had left him with a mountain of debt, and Kaiden had been running from the collectors ever since. He had thought that his job would be his salvation, but now it seemed like everything was falling apart.

As he entered the apartment, he spotted the mysterious girl still sleeping on the couch. 

"Is she going to sleep all day?" he muttered to himself, moving closer to her.

He noticed that she was wearing a traditional dress, intricately embroidered with symbols he didn't recognize. Her white hair cascaded down her back like a river of snow, surprisingly long and silky.

Kaiden's curiosity got the better of him, and he found himself wondering if she was an actress or a model. He reached out a hand to touch her cheek, but before he could make contact, her eyes snapped open.

Kaiden was suddenly pinned down, a sword pressed to his neck.

 "Who are you?" the girl demanded, her voice cold and menacing.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. 

"Wow, so you can talk," he laughed nervously.

The girl's expression didn't change.

 "Answer me," she said, the blade cutting into Kaiden's neck slightly.

Kaiden winced in pain. "You fainted on my car, and I brought you home since I didn't know anything about you," he explained fearfully.

The girl's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Kaiden thought he saw a flicker of recognition. And then, she returned the sword to its sheath and stood up, towering over Kaiden.

Kaiden let out a sigh of relief as he sat up, rubbing his sore neck. 

"I saved you, and you're trying to kill me instead," he scoffed, getting up and heading to the kitchen.

He returned a few minutes later with a steaming bowl of noodles. "You must be hungry," he said, offering her the food. "You should eat this."

"Get out. I'm not eating that." The girl snap.

Kaiden shrugged. "Good for you, then." He turned and headed to his room.

Maledicta stared at the food for a while, her stomach growling with hunger. And then, suddenly, she had a taste for it. She gulped down the noodles in one swift motion, not even bothering to chew.

As she finished eating, she felt a strange sensation wash over her. It was as if she had been starving for days, and the food had awakened a deep hunger within her.

Kaiden's eyes sparkled with amusement as he moved closer to Maledicta. "So you're really hungry," he said, his voice low and teasing.

But Maledicta didn't respond. Instead, she started moving towards the exit door.

 "So you're going to leave without a single thank you?" he asked, his voice tinged with annoyance.

 "You put me in so much trouble today." He added.

He grabbed her arm, spinning her around to face him. But as soon as he touched her, Maledicta's eyes glazed over, and she saw a vision.

It was Kaiden, lying in a pool of his own blood, his head cracked open, and men surrounding him with axes. Maledicta's eyes snapped back into focus, her expression grim.

Kaiden's eyes narrowed, concern etched on his face. 

"What's wrong with you?" he asked, his voice soft.

"One of the things I hate most in this world is owing someone," she said coldly.

 "So consider this as paying back for saving me." She said and close her eyes.

Kaiden's eyes widened in confusion. "What are you talking about?" he asked, but before he could get an answer, a portal opened behind Maledicta.

She grabbed Kaiden's arm, dragging him into the portal. Kaiden's eyes went wide as they were sucked into the swirling vortex.

When they emerged on the other side, Kaiden stumbled, his eyes adjusting to the bright lights. They were standing in the middle of Nightshade Wonderland, the school's sprawling campus stretching out before them.

Kaiden's eyes widened as he took in the sight.

 "What is this place?" he asked, his voice full of wonder.

   “Your new home” Maledicta said coldly and started leaving.

(A STUDENT AT NIGHTSHADE WONDERLAND)

Kaiden's eyes blazed with anger as he yelled after Maledicta. 

"Hey, hey, hey, hey girl! You can't bring me to this strange place without my permission and suddenly tell me it's my new home!" He yelled.

But Maledicta didn't even flinch. She just kept walking, her long white hair swaying behind her.

Kaiden's frustration boiled over, and he grabbed her arm, spinning her around to face him. 

"You didn't even let me know the type of place this was," he yelled. "What if it's dangerous?"

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger, and she jerked her arm free. 

"Don't ever touch me again," she said coldly, her voice dripping with venom.

Kaiden's eyes widened as he realized his mistake. He took a step back, his hands raised in a placating gesture. 

"Sorry, I did;n't mean to—"

But Maledicta was already walking away, leaving Kaiden standing alone in the middle of the courtyard.

That's when Kaiden finally noticed the pool of people staring at him. They were all dressed in strange, elaborate clothing, and their eyes seemed to be boring into his soul.

"Is he a human?" one of them asked, their voice full of curiosity.

"I don't know, I haven't seen one before," another one replied. "I just read about them."

"He looks strange, though," a third one added, their eyes narrowing as they glared at Kaiden.

Kaiden stood frozen, unsure of what to do. They all seemed to be mad at him, and he had no idea why.

He took a deep breath and decided to walk around, trying to get a feel for the place. As he strolled through the courtyard, he noticed that everyone seemed to be staring at him.

He saw a girl who suddenly vanished into thin air, and another person who was flying through the air with ease. Kaiden's eyes widened as he realized that these people were not normal.

They were all...magical.

Kaiden's mind reeled as he tried to process what he was seeing. He had always thought of himself as a rational person, but this place was challenging everything he thought he knew.

As he walked, Kaiden noticed that the buildings around him seemed to be shifting and changing. The walls seemed to be made of a strange, glowing material, and the windows seemed to be staring back at him like empty eyes.

Kaiden's skin crawled as he realized that he was completely out of his depth. He had no idea what this place was, or what its inhabitants wanted from him.

All he knew was that he wanted to get out of there as fast as he could.

But as he turned to leave, Kaiden realized that he had no idea where he was going. The courtyard seemed to be shifting and changing around him, and he couldn't see any exits.

He was trapped.

And then, Kaiden heard a voice behind him. 

"Welcome to Nightshade Wonderland," it said. 

"You're going to be here for a while.” the voice added. He look around but found nothing, he was a little terrified but he didn't even know who to approach among the strange people.

Mistress Morwen swept into her room, her long, flowing hair billowing behind her. She was greeted by the sight of Maledicta sitting in the corner, her eyes closed.

"I told you not to sneak into my room anymore," Mistress Morwen snapped, her voice stern.

Maledicta's eyes flickered open, her gaze locking onto Mistress Morwen's.

 "Why did you call for me?" she asked, her voice neutral.

 "What is the commotion going on in the school? Did I hear you brought a human here?" Mistress Morwen asked.

 "If you heard already, why did you call me here to ask again?" Maledicta asked, her voice tinged with annoyance.

Mistress Morwen's face fell, her eyes clouding with concern. "You know the implications of what you've done, Maledicta. We haven't mingled with humans for over six hundred years, and now you've suddenly brought one here. What if the rumors spread to the town and the councils found out?" She asked worriedly.

Maledicta's expression turned cold. "I don't care," she said, her voice flat.

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened in shock.

 "Wow, really? You're going to return him right now. You could be punished by the Goddess for bringing someone from the future." Mistress Morwen said.

Maledicta's gaze didn't waver. "Aren't I being punished already? Carrying the curse of what I know nothing about. I don't care about what your sweet Goddess thinks, but I'm not returning him."she said.

Mistress Morwen's face fell, her eyes filling with worry. "But what came over you, Maledicta? He has no power, he could be bullied. This place is dangerous." She said.

 "He is not to be touched." Maledicta said.

Mistress Morwen's eyes narrowed. "Maledicta, why are—"she was saying but Maledicta cut her off. 

"He's dying. This is the only way I could think of. I owe him my life." She said calmly.

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened in surprise.

 "Are you telling me you care about his life?" She asked.

Maledicta didn't respond. She just vanished into thin air, leaving Mistress Morwen staring at the empty space.

Mistress Morwen's face broke into a smile. She was surprised, but also pleased. Maybe this human could be just what Maledicta needed.

The door suddenly opened, and Benedicta walked in.

 "So is the boy going back? Were you able to convince her?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Mistress Morwen's smile grew wider. "I couldn't, you know her."

Benedicta's face fell. "This is so bad. Why are you smiling, Mom?"

Mistress Morwen's eyes twinkled. "That boy is special. I want him to stay."

Benedicta's eyes widened in surprise. "What, Mom? What about the—"she was saying But Mistress Morwen cut her off.

 "Forget about them. Maledicta cares about him. She brought him here to save him." Mistress Morwen said.

Benedicta's eyes went wide. "Care? Maledicts care about someone? A human?" She asked.

Mistress Morwen's smile grew wider. "Shocking, right? He might be of help to her. So we're welcoming him. Prepare a very special room for him. He has to feel okay and satisfied." Mistress Morwen said.

Benedicta's face was still frozen in shock, but she nodded slowly. "Okay, Mom."

As Benedicta left, Mistress Morwen's smile grew even wider. She had a feeling that this human was going to change everything.

           QUEEN EPUSA COVEN

The Queen Epusa Coven was a place of darkness and foreboding, where the very air seemed to vibrate with malevolent energy. The demons that inhabited this realm moved with an unnatural gait, their twisted forms seeming to shift and writhe like living shadows.

At the center of this dark coven stood a throne, upon which sat the queen herself. Epusa was a woman of imposing presence, her two curved horns gleaming with a sickly, yellowish light. Her black gown seemed to absorb the faint illumination that filtered through the coven, making her appear almost like a void incarnate.

Snakes slithered and curled around her body, their forked tongues darting in and out of their mouths as they seemed to sense the dark energy that emanated from their mistress.

A figure entered the coven, bowing its head in a gesture of abject submission. 

"Did you find him?" Epusa asked, her voice low and menacing.

The figure trembled, its voice barely above a whisper. "I...I couldn't, my queen."

Epusa's expression turned icy, her eyes flashing with anger. 

"What? You couldn't?" she yelled, her voice like a crack of thunder. The wind seemed to respond to her fury, picking up and sending several demons tumbling through the air.

The figure cowered, its eyes fixed on the ground.

 "I am sorry, my queen. Maledicta suddenly showed up and ruined everything." He said.

Epusa's gaze narrowed, her eyes burning with intensity. 

"That girl came to the future?" she asked, her voice dripping with malice.

The figure nodded, still trembling.

 "Yes, my queen. But I think she is dead. I stabbed her twice with a dagger poisoned with blackthorn juice." He said.

Epusa's expression turned skeptical. 

"Where is her body?" she asked, her voice cold.

The figure hesitated, its eyes darting around the coven as if searching for an escape route.

 "I...I couldn't find it, my queen. She must be dead somewhere." He said nervously.

Epusa's laughter was like a cold wind, sending shivers down the spines of the demons that cowered around her. 

"You are really foolish to think that girl is dead," she said, her voice dripping with contempt. "You don't know the type of person she is."

The figure took a step back, its eyes wide with fear. 

"She can't survive the stab to her chest," he protested.

Epusa's expression turned glacial.

 "If you can't get him, then where is the stone I gave you?" she asked, her voice like a knife cutting through the air.

The figure hesitated, its eyes dropping to the ground.

 "It was destroyed when Maledicta showed up," it mumbled.

Epusa's scream was like a crack of thunder, shaking the very foundations of the coven.

 "What!!" she yelled, springing up from her throne. "The stone I used all my energy to build, how dare you!"

The figure cowered, its eyes fixed on the ground as Epusa's snakes slithered towards it, their forked tongues darting in and out of their mouths.

But before the snakes could strike, Maledicta suddenly appeared in their midst, her eyes blazing with fury. The demons nearby scurried for cover, hiding themselves from her wrath.

The snakes that had been approaching the figure suddenly burst into flames, their ashes drifting to the groung.

    “How dare you came into my place without my permission” Epusa yelled angrily. Maledicta ignored Epusa's furious gaze and strode towards the cowering figure.

With a swift, deadly motion, she stabbed the figure straight in the chest. And then, just as suddenly, she vanished into thin air.

Epusa's eyes blazed with fury as she watched her demon melt into a puddle of goo. 

"That witch, I will kill her," she snarled, her voice like a rusty gate.

She knew she had to do something fast and stop the girl before she turn to something else.

Kaiden was still looking around, trying to make sense of the strange and eerie atmosphere that seemed to permeate every corner of the school. He had approached a lot of people, but none of them seemed willing to talk to him. They just ignored him, their eyes gliding past him as if he were invisible.

Just when he was starting to feel like a ghost, someone tapped him on the back. He turned to see a boy with piercing blue eyes and black hair. The boy was smiling, but there was something about his smile that seemed off.

"Hey," kaiden said with a smile.

"Follow me," he added, already turning to leave.

Kaiden hesitated for a moment, before following the boy.

"I'm Kaiden, by the way," Kaiden said, trying to sound friendly.

“Ryder” the boy said.

Ryder muttered something under his breath, but Kaiden couldn't quite catch it.

"Ryder, please, what is this place?" Kaiden asked, his eyes scanning the strange and unfamiliar surroundings.

A school."Ryder shrugged. “

Kaiden raised an eyebrow. "That's true, but it looks kinda strange and I'm getting the creeps." He said.

Ryder's smile grew wider, but his eyes seemed to glint with malice. "If it looks so weird, you can just leave. Nobody's forcing you to stay." He muttered.

 "Wow, you're so rude. I don't think you like me too." Kaiden said.

Ryder's smile never wavered. "Of course I don't like you. And to be honest, I don't think anyone in this place does. We hate humans." He said plainly.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock. "What? Why?" he asked, but Ryder just ignored him and pushed open a door.

"This is your room," Ryder said, his voice dripping with disdain. 

"Have fun. If you need anything, it call my name and I'll come to you." He added.

Before Kaiden could respond, Ryder was already out of sight, leaving him staring at the closed door in confusion.

Kaiden shook his head, muttering to himself. "This place is so weird."

But as he entered the room, he was surprised to see how beautiful it was. The walls were adorned with traditional paintings, and the furniture was intricately carved with strange symbols. The bed looked comfortable, and Kaiden couldn't resist lying down on it.

As he sank into the soft mattress, he couldn't help but wonder why he had been brought here by the strange girl. But as he looked around the room, he started to think that maybe staying here wouldn't be so bad after all. At least here, he wouldn't have to worry about being hunted by loan sharks and debt collectors.

Kaiden got up and walked over to the wardrobe, which was filled with traditional clothes and shoes. He couldn't understand how they had prepared all this so quickly.

As he browsed through the clothes, he noticed that they all seemed to be made of high-quality materials, and the designs were intricate and beautiful. Kaiden felt a pang of curiosity. Who were these people, and why were they treating him like royalty? He shrugged it off and went to lay back on the bed.

                THE NEXT DAY    

Kaiden stared at himself in the mirror, hardly recognizing the person staring back at him. The soap here seemed to have a special magic that made his skin look fresh and radiant. He felt amazing, like a new person.

He gazed at the traditional clothes laid out before him, and his eyes widened in wonder. The intricate designs and patterns seemed to shimmer and shine in the light, and Kaiden couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.

He picked up the clothes and began to dress, marveling at how well they fit him. His long hair, which he had tried to cut a long time ago but had grown back within three days, cascaded down his back like a river of gold.

He took a deep breath and stepped out of his room, into the bustling hallway. Students rushed past him. Kaiden watched them, feeling a sense of curiosity.

Where were they all going in such a hurry?

Just then, someone touched his arm, and Kaiden turned to see Ryder standing beside him, a smile on his face.

"Hey,Let's go to the dining hall. It's breakfast time." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Wow, did you just smile at me?" he asked, his voice full of wonder.

Ryder's smile faltered for a moment, before he shrugged. "Like I have a choice. Mistress Morwen said I have to be nice to you." He said.

Kaiden chuckled, feeling a sense of amusement. "Well, I appreciate the effort," he said, grinning.

As they entered the dining hall, Kaiden's eyes widened in wonder. The room was huge, with long tables stretching out before him. Students sat at the tables, eating and chatting, while others flew through the air, serving food and drinks.

Kaiden stared, his mouth hanging open.

Ryder rolled his eyes, but a small smile played on his lips. 

“Close your mouth," he muttered.

As they sat down at a table, Kaiden's eyes landed on the food in front of him. It looked delicious, but he hesitated, unsure of what to do.

Ryder urged him to try it, and Kaiden took a tentative bite. His eyes widened in surprise as the flavors exploded on his tongue.

"Wow, this is really good," he exclaimed, digging in with gusto.

As he ate, Kaiden noticed that some of the students were staring at him, their faces curious. Some of the girls even waved at him, and Kaiden felt surprise.

Why were they being so friendly all of a sudden?

Just then, a group of students walked into the dining hall, their faces set with pride. They looked confident and self-assured, and Kaiden couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.

"Who are they?" he asked Ryder, his voice barely above a whisper.

Ryder bowed his head, along with the other students.

 "They're our seniors, the strongest and most powerful students here. They're treated with respect." He whispered.

Kaiden watched, fascinated, as the seniors made their way to a special table at the front of the room.

Just then, one of the seniors caught his eye. She had bright red hair, and her eyes sparkled with amusement as she smiled at him.

"Who's that?" Kaiden asked Ryder

Ryder followed his gaze. "That's Senior Benedicta, Maledicta's twin sister. I mean, the girl who brought you here." He said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Why isn't she here, then?" he asked, looking around the room.

Ryder shrugged. "Senior Maledicta will never eat with others. She likes doing everything alone." He said.

Just then, the doors to the dining hall burst open, and Maledicta strode in, her eyes fixed on some point across the room.

The students gasped, their faces shocked. Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise as Maledicta made her way to the senior table.

   “Morning senior” Arachne called excitedly from her sit but Maledicta didn't even spare her a glance.

"I need to talk to her," Kaiden said, standing up from his seat.

Ryder tried to stop him, but Kaiden was already halfway across the room, his eyes fixed on Maledicta.

As he approached her,The students were watching, their faces curious.

Maledicta's eyes were fixed on the senior table, But before she could reach her destination, Kaiden grabbed her arm, spinning her around to face him.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low and serious.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger.

 "What did I say about holding me without my permission?" she spat, her voice venomous. 

"Let me go now before you regret it." He added.

Kaiden's grip on her arm didn't waver. "I'm not letting you go until you explain some things to me," he snapped back.

The students around them gasped, their faces shocked by Kaiden's boldness. Cassius was glaring at Kaiden, his eyes narrowed in anger, while Belladonna had a smirk on her face, clearly enjoying the drama.

Maledicta tried to shake off Kaiden's grip, but he held tight, his fingers digging into her skin. She tried to use her powers to make him release her, but to her shock, nothing happened.

Kaiden didn't even flinch, his eyes never leaving hers. 

"Quit being stubborn, you're not even that strong," he said, his voice dripping with contempt.

And with that, he swooped down and picked Maledicta up, carrying her in bridal style as he strode out of the cafeteria. Maledicta struggled and kicked, but Kaiden's grip was like a vice, holding her in place.

The students watched in stunned silence as Kaiden carried Maledicta out of the cafeteria, their mouths hanging open in shock.

As they left the dining hall, Lilith turned to Thane and Belladonna, her eyes wide with surprise. 

"What was that?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane chuckled, "Maledicta, just allowing the human boy to carry her," he said.

Belladonna smirked, "The boy is interesting," she said.

Cassius, on the other hand, stormed out of the dining hall, his face dark with anger. Benedicta watched him go.

Meanwhile, Maledicta was seething with rage, her face pale with fury.

 "Drop me right now," she yelled, her voice echoing off the walls.

Kaiden finally dropped her, and Maledicta's feet hit the ground with a soft thud. She glared up at Kaiden, her eyes blazing with anger.

"Can we talk now?" Kaiden asked calmly.

"Bastard," she spat, her hand flying up to slap Kaiden across the face.

Kaiden's head rocked back, but he didn't flinch. Instead, he watched as Maledicta vanished into thin air.

"She looks really angry," Kaiden muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing in thought.

Just then, Ryder appeared at his side, he was glaring at him.

"What?" Kaiden asked, his eyebrows rising in surprise.

 "Didn't I warn you not to go near her? Did you hate your life?" Ryder snapped, his voice cold.

Kaiden shrugged, his expression calm. "I did, I just wanted to clear some misunderstandings."

Ryder's eyes widened in incredulity. "Clear things with Maledicta? Do you know the type of person she is? She could have killed you without thinking twice. You even carried her – the audacity!" Ryder scoffed.

"She's not like you're painting her to be. Though she's quiet and reserved, she's not heartless." Kaiden said while glaring at Ryder.

Ryder's laughter was cold and mirthless. "Wow, you think so? You'll find out soon enough. I'm not going to stress myself." Ryder said and started leaving.

"Where are you going?" Kaiden asked while running after him.

"To the training ground. We're training with the seniors today." Ryder said without looking at him.

Kaiden's face lit up with excitement. "I'm coming with you, then."

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise. "You can't. You don't even have powers or much strength." He said.

 "I can still learn without powers. You don't expect me to stay around without doing anything." He said.

Ryder shrugged, a small smile playing on his lips. "Let's go, then."

Together, they followed the students streaming into the huge training ground.

Maledicta's room was a reflection of her dark and troubled soul. The walls were devoid of any decoration, the only furniture a single bed positioned at the center of the room. The air was thick with the scent of dark roses, their velvety petals seeming to absorb the faint light that filtered through the windows.

A small bowl of water sat on the floor, its surface reflecting the faint glow of the candles that lit the room. As Maledicta lay on the bed, her eyes closed, the water began to stir, as if an invisible force was manipulating it.

The droplets of water started to float in the air, swirling around the room in a mesmerizing dance. Maledicta's body began to rise from the bed, her limbs splayed out to the sides as she hovered in mid-air.

Her eyes remained closed, her face serene, as if she were in a state of deep meditation. But her mind was racing, her thoughts consumed by the events of the morning.

She had been drawn to the dining hall, compelled by a force she couldn't explain. And when she saw Kaiden, she felt a jolt of... something. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but it was a feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time.

As she floated in the air, Maledicta's eyes finally snapped open. She gazed around the room, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. The water droplets slowly descended back to the bowl, and Maledicta's body gently sank back onto the bed.

She sat up, her eyes fixed on some point in front of her. 

"I have my powers now," she muttered to herself. 

"I didn't lose them. So why can't I do anything to him?" She wondered.

She thought back to the way Kaiden had grabbed her arm, the way he had carried her out of the dining hall. She had been powerless in his grasp, unable to use her powers to defend herself.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. What was it about Kaiden that made her so vulnerable? And why had she been drawn to the dining hall this morning?

Just as she was starting to ponder these questions, a voice whispered in her head. 
"To the training ground."

Maledicta's eyes snapped open, her heart racing with anticipation. It was the voice again, the one that guide her to the dinning hall this morning.

She threw off the covers and stood up, her eyes fixed on some point in front of her. 

"Does that mean he's there too?" she muttered to herself.

"Something is wrong with me," she muttered to herself. "Something weird."

She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as she tried to calm her racing thoughts. But the voice in her head was still whispering, still guiding her towards the training ground. She try her best to ignore it.

Kaiden's eyes widened as he gazed around the training ground. Everything about this place was just amazing. The traditional equipment, the students training with precision and skill, it all seemed so fascinating.

He couldn't wait to try it out for himself. He watched as some students sparred with each other, their movements swift and deadly. Others were practicing their archery skills, their arrows flying straight and true.

Kaiden felt a pang of envy. He wished he could be one of them, training and honing his skills alongside these talented students.

As he stood there, some girls started waving at him, their faces breaking out into giggles. Kaiden's face flushed with embarrassment, but he couldn't help feeling a sense of pride.

He had never been the center of attention before, and it felt strange but exhilarating.

Ryder, who had been quiet until now, spoke up. "Come on, Kaiden. Let's go find a senior to train you."

But before they could move, someone stepped in front of them, blocking their path.

"What are you doing here?" Cassius growled, his eyes narrowing at Kaiden.

Kaiden smiled,  "I'm here to train, just like everyone else." He said.

"You think you can train with us? You're just a human."Cassius snorted.

Kaiden felt a surge of anger, but before he could respond, Belladonna spoke up.

"Come on, Cassius, let him do what he wants," she said, her voice smooth as silk.

"I won't let him embarrass himself," Cassius snapped.

"He has to learn something, at least he should know how to use a sword when the time comes." Lilith said.

Cassius scowled, but eventually nodded. "Fine. But he's going to have to prove himself."

And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving Kaiden feeling confused.

The other students began to train, their movements swift and deadly. Kaiden watched, trying to learn from them, but he couldn't help feeling like an outsider. He wish he have super power like them too.

Cassius reappeared, a sword in his hand. "You can't just stand there doing nothing," he sneered. "You have to prove yourself."

And with that, he threw the sword at Kaiden, who caught it awkwardly, his hand shaking.

Cassius gestured to a boy standing nearby. 

"Battle with him. He's the weakest in our school." He smirk.

The battle began, and Kaiden quickly realized that he was no match for the boy. The boy used all sorts of tricks and techniques, leaving Kaiden stumbling to keep up.

Within minutes, Kaiden was bleeding from the nose and mouth, his face battered and bruised.

 "Cassius, stop this fight! You know he's weak." Lilith quickly said.

But Cassius just shook his head. "He has to be strong."

"He's just human, Cassius. You can't expect him to keep up with us." Belladonna speak up.

 "Let him learn." Cassius snapped.

The students watched in pity as the boy continued to beat Kaiden.

Just when it seemed like the boy was about to deliver the final blow, he suddenly flew backward, his back hitting the wall with a thud.

Benedicta stormed over, "I can't believe you're trying to get him killed." She said angrily.

She rushed over to Kaiden, helping him to his feet. "Come on, I'll take you somewhere safe." He said.

And with that, she led Kaiden away, leaving the other students staring after them.

Benedicta's hands were soft and gentle as she cupped Kaiden's cheeks, her eyes closing as if in concentration. Kaiden watched her curiously, wondering what she was up to.

At first, he felt a strange tingling sensation, like pins and needles, but it quickly gave way to a warm, soothing feeling that seemed to spread throughout his face. Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise as he realized that the pain from his wounds was gone.

He pulled away from Benedicta's grasp, his hands flying to his face to explore the skin. It was smooth and unblemished, with no sign of the cuts and bruises that had marred it just moments before.

"How did you do that?" Kaiden asked, his voice full of wonder.

Benedicta smiled, her eyes opening to regard him with a warm, gentle gaze. "It's one of the things I can do," she said, her voice soft and melodious.

Kaiden's eyes widened in amazement. "Wow, you're impressive," he exclaimed.

Benedicta's smile grew wider,  "I'm Benedicta,"Maledicta's twin sister." She said.

 "I know,Someone told me." Kaiden smile.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment, before she regained her composure. 

"Oh, I didn't know, I am sorry for how he treated you" she said.

  “It's okay, he is just trying to help” Kaiden said.

    “But he should have take it easy” she whispered.

Kaiden's eyes locked onto hers, "Didn't you hate me?" he asked.

 "I learned that everyone here does." He added.

Benedicta's smile was tinged with sadness. "Let's just say I do...or at least, I did," she said.

 "Until I saw you, and then I told myself, what happened wasn't your fault." She added.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Something happened?What is it?" He asked curiously.

"We can talk about it another time," she said.

 "You're just so different from your sister," he said, his voice filled with wonder.

 "I hear that a lot," she said, her voice filled with emotion. "But whatever she is, it wasn't her fault." Benedicta said.

"I know too," he said.

 "I think I should let you go , You can go and rest in your room." Benedicta said.

Kaiden nodded ,"Thanks," he said.

As Benedicta stood up, Kaiden watched her, his eyes drinking in the sight of her. She was so different from Maledicta, so warm and gentle.

"Not everyone is so bad," Kaiden said to himself, a smile spreading across his face.

He watched until Benedicta was out of sight, before turning to make his way back to his room. 

Maybe, just maybe, this place wasn't so bad after all.

     QUEEN EPUSA COVEN

The dark and foreboding atmosphere of the Queen Epusa Coven was palpable, the air thick with malevolent energy. Epusa, the queen herself, stood tall and imposing, her two curved horns gleaming with an otherworldly light.

As a girl entered the center of the coven, Epusa's face broke into a wide, warm smile. She strode forward, her long black gown billowing behind her, and swept the girl into a tight, crushing hug.

"My daughter," Epusa exclaimed, her voice dripping with affection. 

"It's been far too long since I've seen you. You haven't changed a bit." She added with a smile.

 "It's been years, how is the kingdom?” The girl Aka asked.

Epusa laughed, a low, throaty sound. "You trust your mother, don't you? I can see it in your eyes. You've been training hard, I can tell. How is Hell? I hope you've been enjoying your time there." She asked.

Aka smirked, her eyes glinting with a manic light. "You trust me, Mother, Did you get my man yet?" she asked, her voice casual.

"We couldn't. That girl Maledicta keeps getting in our way." Epusa said.

Aka's face darkened, her eyes flashing with anger. "I hear she's quite powerful,  "I'll go to their school and kill her. Don't worry, Mother." She said.

"But you just arrived, Aka. I think you should rest first. That girl isn't to be underestimated." Epusa said.

Aka raised an eyebrow, her expression incredulous. "Was I to be underestimated, Mother?" She asked.

Epusa's smile returned,  "No, daughter. Lucifer himself told me how strong you've become." She said.

"Then watch as I bring her head to you, Mother." Aka said.

And with that, she vanished into thin air, leaving Epusa to smile proudly after her.

"She really is my daughter," Epusa said to herself, her voice dripping with pride.

"Where have you been all day?" Ryder asked, his eyes narrowing slightly as Kaiden sat down beside him.

"I was in my room." Kaiden said.

 "How are you? I was a little worried about you." Ryder asked.

 "I'm okay, Benedicta healed me." He said.

Ryder's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Wow, Kaiden, I can't believe you two are talking."

Kaiden chuckled, "Yeah, I know. It's weird."

Just then, a commotion broke out nearby, with people running. Kaiden's eyes snapped towards the chaos.

"What's going on?" he asked Ryder.

"Senior Maledicta must be nearby, they run whenever they see her." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Why are they running from her?"

"Because she's someone to be avoided." Ryder whisper to him.

As if on cue, Maledicta appeared, her head down and her eyes fixed on the ground. She walked with a quiet confidence, her very presence seeming to command attention.

But as she walked, someone suddenly bumped into her, and Maledicta's head snapped up, her eyes flashing with anger. The person who had bumped into her gasped in shock, their eyes wide with fear.

"I'm sorry, Senior," the girl apologized, her voice trembling.

But before she could say another word, she started choking, her hands flying to her neck as she stumbled and fell to the ground.

Kaiden and Ryder watched in horror as Maledicta drew her sword, its blade glinting in the fading light. With one swift, deadly motion, she cut the girl's head off, her expression unchanging.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock, his mind reeling with horror.

 "How could she?" he demanded, his voice shaking with anger.

 "She must really be in a bad mood. That's why I told you to avoid her." Ryder said.

But Kaiden was already standing up, his eyes fixed on Maledicta's retreating back. 

"That's unfair,i need to talk to her." He said and started going after him.

Ryder's eyes widened in alarm. "Are you crazy?" he yelled, grabbing Kaiden's arm.

But Kaiden shook him off,  "I have to do this," he said, and set off after Maledicta.

Ryder watched him go, his eyes filled with concern. "Kaiden, come back!" he shouted, but Kaiden didn't listen.
.
.
.

Maledicta's hand was on the doorknob, ready to enter her room, when she suddenly stopped and turned around. Her eyes narrowed as she saw Kaiden approaching, his face blazing with anger.

"Why did you kill her?" Kaiden demanded.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, "You don't have the right to question me," she said, her voice cold and detached.

She turned to enter her room, but Kaiden was too quick. He grabbed her arm, spinning her back around to face him.

"She mistakenly bumped into you and apologized, but you killed her instead,You're so heartless."Kaiden said, his voice trembling with rage. 

Maledicta's expression didn't change,"Of course, I am," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

 "What are you going to do about it?" She asked.

Kaiden's face was red with anger, his eyes blazing with fury. "Wow, just because you're stronger than others doesn't mean you can kill them," he said, his voice rising. 

"You're so wicked, you may think people will fear you because of your...your...powers, but you're just ruining your own life” he said.

"And You'll continue to live alone, with no friends, until you die," Kaiden said, his voice dripping with venom. 

"And for the record, I hate you so much." He said and with that, he turned and stormed off, leaving Maledicta standing alone in the corridor.

For a moment, Maledicta just stood there, her eyes fixed on the spot where Kaiden had disappeared. Then, without thinking, she raised a hand to her cheek and touched something wet.

She stared at her fingers in shock, her eyes widening as she realized that she was crying. Tears were streaming down her face, and she couldn't seem to stop them.

Maledicta's eyes were fixed on the tears, her mind reeling with shock. She had never cried before, not even as a child and here she is crying.

          (PUNISHMENT)

Mistress Morwen looked up from the ancient magic book she was studying, a look of exasperation crossing her face as Maledicta suddenly appeared in front of her.

"You will never listen to me, will you?" Mistress Morwen groaned, her voice tinged with frustration.

Maledicta's eyes were blazing with intensity. "That boy, I want him back now. We can send him back, right?" she demanded.

 "I'm sorry, girl, but I don't think that's possible." Mistress Morwen said.

Maledicta's face darkened. "What are you talking about? You wanted me to send him back, so what's wrong?" she asked, her voice rising in frustration.

Mistress Morwen leaned back in her chair, a thoughtful expression on her face. "I've changed my mind, Maledicta. I think it's good that we're saving someone for a change." She said.

 "That's not the reason. You know something, don't you?" she accused, her voice dripping with suspicion.

"I have no idea what you're talking about, Maledicta. I thought you wanted him to stay, so what's changed?" Mistress Morwen said innocently.

Maledicta's face twisted in anger. "He's weird. He's making me do things I would never do. My powers aren't even working on him," she spat.

"Oh, what a surprise," Mistress Morwen said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger. "You didn't look that surprised, though. You must know what's wrong with me. Explain all these new feelings now," she demanded, her voice rising.

"I don't know, Maledicta, but don't you think that whatever it is, it's something good?" she asked, her voice soft.

 "I don't care if it's good or bad. I hate this feeling, and I want it to stop," Maledicta spat angrily.With that, she stormed out of the room, slamming the door loudly behind her.

As she emerged into the corridor, she almost collided with Benedicta, who was walking in the opposite direction.

"Sister," Benedicta called out, her voice excited, her face breaking out into a warm smile.

But Maledicta ignored her and started leaving.

    “Are you okay? You didn't look so good” Benedicta said while running after her.

 "You can stop acting like you care. No one is around to see your two-faced act," Maledicta muttered coldly and with that, she intentionally bumped into Benedicta, sending her stumbling backward.

Benedicta's face was unreadable as she stared after Maledicta, her eyes following her sister until she was out of sight.

"Kaiden," Ryder called gently, his voice breaking the silence of the night.

Kaiden turned to see Ryder approaching him, a look of concern etched on his face.

"You can't be walking around alone, It's not safe." Ryder said.

 “I just need fresh hair” He muttered while staring at the ground, he couldn't seem to forget Maledicta expression when he was yelling at her.

"So you really went after her?" Ryder asked after sometimes.

Kaiden nodded, his eyes still fixed on the ground. "Of course, I had to let her know what she did was wrong." He said.

 "She didn't kill for nothing, Kaiden. She could have hurt people, but she didn't kill. So when she killed that girl over something so minor, we were all shocked." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes snapped up,  "What do you mean?" He asked curiously.

"We found something out." Ryder said.

 "What is it?"Kaiden asked.

 "The girl she kill was a demon." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock. "What's that?"

"Demons are the worst enemies we have here in Nightshade. They're led by their queen, Epusa, and they're very dangerous. They kill us, Kaiden, and they always sneak into town and school to do it." Ryder explained.

 "So what is she doing here?" Kaiden asked.

"That's another surprise. Demons haven't been able to sneak into our school for years, but somehow they broke our shield and got in. We have to rebuild the shield, but it's possible that a lot of them are already inside. That's why it's so dangerous, Kaiden. The demons are tricky and can blend in seamlessly." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes were wide with fear and understanding.

 "Are you saying Maledicta saved us?" He asked.

Ryder nodded, "Yes, Kaiden. If she hadn't spotted that demon, who knows how many people would have been killed?" Ryder said.

Kaiden's face was pale, his eyes haunted by the realization of what he had done.

 "I'll go to my room," he said quietly.

 "Please, Kaiden, you have to be careful. The demons are still out there, and we don't know what they're capable of." Ryder said.

Kaiden's mind was reeling with thoughts and emotions as he walked back to his room. He couldn't forget the harsh words he had spoken to Maledicta, and he couldn't help but feel bad for it.

He wished he could take it back, wished he could apologize and make things right. But he didn't know if that was even possible, he feel so guilty.

Aka suddenly appeared in the throne room, a slight cut on her neck. She stumbled forward, her eyes fixed on Epusa, before she almost fell. But she managed to catch herself, supporting her weight with the wall.

Epusa's eyes widened in concern as she rushed to Aka's side.

 "Are you okay?" she asked worriedly, examining the cut on Aka's neck.

Aka waved her hand dismissively. "This is nothing. I'll soon be okay.” She said and  the cut on her neck began to close up, the skin knitting together seamlessly. Aka started laughing, a manic glint in her eye.

"What happened there?" Epusa asked, her eyes narrowing with concern.

Aka's laughter grew louder,  "I must have underestimated her, just like you said. I disguised myself as one of their students and tried to poison her, but she figured me out."

Aka's laughter grew even louder, her body shaking with mirth. "I begged her to spare my life, but she cut my head off instead." She said.

 "I told you she's not to be looked down on. That girl was born with the power of the world. She can control anything, and she attracts doom to herself and to anyone around her." Epusa said.

Aka's laughter finally began to subside,  "I'm not giving up after one trial. Her power can be useful to me too." Aka said.

"What's your plan?"Epusa's eyes narrowed.

Aka's smile grew wider. "I'll go to the school like a normal student. I'll try to get close to her, and then I'll get her." She said.

 "That can be dangerous. You're not even sure if you can trust yourself around her." Epusa said.

Aka's eyes flashed with confidence. "I know what to do. The moment I enter the school, we can bring in demons and take over." She said.

Epusa's face broke out into a wide smile. "I trust you," she said.

The meeting room was filled with tension as Maledicta walked in, her eyes scanning the room with a hint of disdain. Belladonna, seated at the far end of the table, let out a frustrated sigh.

"I don't know why we always have to wait for you," Belladonna said, her voice dripping with annoyance.

Maledicta ignored her, her eyes fixed on an empty chair as she made her way towards it. She sat down.

 "The school is in danger,We have to be extra careful now and protect the students” Thane said.

 "The shield was broken too. We need extra energy to repair it. Will you help with that, Male?" Cassius asked while staring at Maledicta.

Maledicta didn't respond, but her silence was answer enough. She stood up, her movements abrupt, and started to leave.

But Belladonna's voice stopped her. "We aren't done with the meeting," she yelled, her face red with anger. "You can't just leave."

Maledicta turned back, her eyes narrowing. "Did you have a problem with me?" she asked, her voice low and menacing.

"Wow, I thought you were deaf. Can you stop being so arrogant and do things with others? It's annoying the way you think you own everything just because your mom is the mistress."Belladonna sneered.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, but her eyes seemed to flash with anger. She superspeeded to Belladonna, her movements a blur, and grabbed her neck.

"I can see you really have a problem with me," Maledicta said, her voice cold and detached.

 "I don't care what it is, but mind the way you speak to me." She said and with that, she released Belladonna, who fell to the ground, coughing up blood. Maledicta turned to leave, but Belladonna, still on the ground, pulled out her sword and tried to attack Maledicta from behind.

But something seemed to throw her off, and she stumbled, her sword flying out of her hand. Cassius, who had been watching the exchange, run after Maledicta.

"Why did you bring that boy here?" he asked.

Maledicta didn't even slow down. 

"You don't expect me to answer that," she said.

Cassius watched as she disappeared into the distance, a small smile playing on his lips.

Kaiden was pacing back and forth in front of Maledicta's door, his mind consumed by thoughts of their previous encounter. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had been too harsh, that he had said things he couldn't take back.

As he turned to pace in the other direction, he suddenly saw Maledicta approaching. His heart skipped a beat as their eyes met, and for a moment, they just stared at each other.

Maledicta's expression was neutral, but Kaiden could sense a hint of wariness in her eyes. She seemed to be waiting for him to make a move, to see what he would do next.

Kaiden took a deep breath and smiled,"Hey," he said, his voice soft.

But Maledicta just ignored him, walking past him as if he didn't exist.

"I'm sorry for last night,I shouldn't have said all those things to you." He quickly said.

Maledicta stopped in her tracks, her back still turned to him. For a moment, she just stood there, frozen.

Then, slowly, she turned to face him. 

"You're not lying,I will remain alone for the rest of my life, and about me ruining my life...I don't think that's possible, because my life is already ruined." She said flatly.

 "I didn't mean anything I said to you," he said, his voice sincere. 

"I was just emotional." He added.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, "You should, especially about hating me. I was born to be hated." She said.

Kaiden's eyes locked onto hers,  "No, you're not,You're so special, more special than others. I'm sure everyone will soon see how special you are. You're not cursed, Maledicta. You're just special." He said and left.

    To her shock, Maledicta felt her lip curve in a smile, something that have never happened before. She quickly run after Kaiden but stop when she saw him hugging Benedicta. The smile disappeared and she turn back immediately.
.
.
.
.

Kaiden's arms wrapped around Benedicta's waist, catching her as she stumbled forward. She had been running to meet him, a bright smile on her face, but her feet seemed to have gotten tangled up in each other.

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked, his voice filled with concern, as he released Benedicta from his grasp.

Benedicta nodded, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "Yeah, thanks for catching me," she said, smiling awkwardly.

Kaiden smiled back,  "No problem. Thanks for yesterday," he said.

 "It was nothing," she said, waving her hand dismissively.

 "I hope you're not getting bored of this place?" She asked.

Kaiden chuckled. "How could I? When I see amazing and unbelievable things every time," he said.

Benedicta laughed, . "Nightshade is amazing, isn't it? I'm sure you weren't able to go around by yourself. I can do the honors if you want," she said while staring at him.

"I would really like that," Kaiden said.

Benedicta smiled, "Then I'll come and get you when I'm ready," she said.

Kaiden nodded and Benedicta turned to leave. 

"You're really having fun, aren't you?" the voice said,Kaiden turned to see a guy standing behind him, a guy he could recognize as one of the seniors. The guy was tall, with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders.

"I'm Thane, by the way," the guy said.

"Kaiden," Kaiden replied.

 "I'll be your trainer from now on and  don't worry, I won't hurt you." Thane said and took him away.
.

Cassius was sitting in his room, surrounded by stacks of dusty old books. He was deeply engrossed in his research, his eyes scanning the pages with a mixture of fascination and intensity.

Suddenly, a hand slipped into his chest, and a soft voice whispered in his ear. "Did you miss me?"

Cassius's eyes snapped up, and he pushed the hand away.

 "I'm not in the mood for this," he said coldly.

Belladonna's face fell, her eyes flashing with anger. "Why are you doing this?" she demanded, her voice rising. 

"I've always been beside you, but you'll keep leaving me for her." She accuse.

Cassius sighed, rubbing his temples. "Don't even start," he groaned.

"What did you even see in that wicked witch?" she yelled, her face red with rage. 

"She doesn't deserve your attention." She said.

"That's enough," he said and start leaving.

But Belladonna wouldn't let up. She followed him, her eyes blazing with anger. 

"You're just going to keep defending her, aren't you?" she spat. "You're just going to keep choosing her over me."

Cassius had had enough. He turned and walked out of the room, leaving Belladonna alone.

Belladonna's face twisted with rage, her fists clenched at her sides. She felt like strangling Maledicta to death, like tearing her apart with her bare hands.

Ryder was sitting with Kaiden in his room, regaling him with stories about their school and its students. The atmosphere was relaxed, with a warm and cozy glow emanating from the lamps scattered around the room.

But as they chatted, the sky outside suddenly darkened, and rain began to fall in thick, heavy drops. Kaiden's eyes lit up with excitement as he jumped up from the bed and rushed to the window.

"The sky is beautiful," he breathed, his eyes fixed on the rain-soaked landscape outside.

"Yeah, a lot of students love playing in the rain. It's warm and healing, and it's said to cure any sickness."Ryder chuckled.

 "I could..." Kaiden began, but his words were cut short by a loud clap of thunder that shook the room.

A high-pitched scream followed immediately, making Kaiden jump in shock.

"What is that?" he asked, his eyes wide with alarm.

Ryder's expression turned somber. "That scream is from Maledicta. She's always like that when thunder strikes."

"Why?" Kaiden asked in surprise.

Ryder's voice dropped to a whisper. "It's part of her curse. She's punished by thunder."

As if to illustrate Ryder's words, another thunderclap boomed outside, and Maledicta's scream echoed through the corridors once more.

Kaiden's eyes were fixed on the window, where he could see Maledicta crawling in the rain, her body convulsing with each thunderclap. She kept screaming and trying to vanish, but she ended up falling back down, her body wracked with pain.

"She's in a lot of pain," Kaiden said worriedly, his eyes fixed on Maledicta's struggling form.

Ryder nodded grimly. "Yeah, she'll continue like this until the rain stops. This always happens every time." He said.

Kaiden's eyes flashed with anger. "And no one tries to help?" He asked.

Ryder shook his head. "No one can interfere. We can just pray that the rain stops on time." Ryder said.

 Kaiden was already moving towards the door.

"I can't watch this. She needs help." He said.

"You can just lay on the bed and cover your ears. That's what most other students do."Ryder said.

But Kaiden was undeterred. "I can't do that. I can't leave her like this." He said.

And with that, he flung open the door and sprinted out into the rain, Ryder's shocked face watching him from the window.

Other students, who had been watching the scene unfold from their own windows, looked on in amazement as Kaiden rushed to Maledicta's side.

Without thinking twice, Kaiden grabbed Maledicta's hand, his eyes locked on her pain-contorted face.

"Are you okay?" he asked worriedly, his voice barely audible over the thunder.

Maledicta couldn't talk, but she hugged Kaiden tightly, her body shaking with cold.

Kaiden wrapped his arms around her, holding her close. 

"Don't worry, you'll be okay." He said.

Maledicta's body relaxed, and she dropped her head onto Kaiden's chest, losing consciousness.

The rain and thunder stopped immediately.

                 (SHIVERS)

The students who were watching from their windows gasped in shock, their eyes wide with amazement. They had never seen anything like this before. Who was this boy who had just rushed out into the rain to help Maledicta?

Cassius's fist was clenched as he watched the scene unfold. Before he knew it, he was storming out of his room, his eyes fixed on Kaiden.

Benedicta, on the other hand, was watching with mixed emotions. She looked concerned, but also a little angry.

As Kaiden shook Maledicta's body, she stirred and started shivering. He picked her up and started walking away, but then he saw Cassius behind him.

"Give her to me," Cassius said, his arm extended.

"I can carry her," Kaiden replied.

Cassius's expression turned cold. "It's not about that. You're supposed to be in your room. You're an ordinary, powerless human. Something could happen to you."

And with that, Cassius snatched Maledicta from Kaiden's grip and started walking away.

Kaiden watched until they were out of sight before turning to go back to his room.

As soon as he walked in, Ryder turned to him, a look of amazement on his face.

"How did you do that?" Ryder asked, his eyes scanning Kaiden's body. "Did you have some sort of power?"

Kaiden scoffed, still feeling a little angry about what Cassius had done.

 "What are you talking about?" He asked.

Ryder's eyes locked onto Kaiden's. "I think you stopped the rain." He said.

"That's impossible. How would I do that?"Kaiden laughed.

Ryder's expression turned serious. "I don't know, but I've never seen anything like it. You didn't even get wet."

Kaiden shook his head. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Ryder started checking Kaiden's body, his hands scanning his arms and chest.

"What's the problem?" Ryder asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

Kaiden sighed. "You didn't find anything because there's nothing to find. I'm just an ordinary human."

Ryder's eyes narrowed. "But that's the thing. You're not acting like an ordinary human. You just did something that three other people have tried before, and they all ended up getting hurt."

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "What do you mean?"

Ryder took a deep breath. "Mistress Morwen tried to help Maledicta once, but she almost died. She spent a week unconscious. Cassius tried too, and he spent a month recovering. And Benedicta...she almost spent three months in bed." He said.

Kaiden's eyes were wide with shock. "And nothing happened to me?"

Ryder shook his head. "No, nothing happened to you. And that's what's so shocking. You're an ordinary human with no powers,I can't even feel any energy and yet you just did something that none of us could do." He said.

Kaiden didn't respond, but he couldn't help but think about why his case was different. Was it just luck, or was there something more to it?. He lay on the bed, his eyes closed, he couldn't stop thinking.
.
.
.
.

Cassius gently laid Maledicta on his bed, her body still shivering from the effects of the thunder strike. He quickly lit up the room, making sure it was warm and cozy, and covered her with his thick blankets.

As he looked at her, he noticed that she was running a fever, her skin cracked and dry from the electricity that had coursed through her body. She was sweating profusely, but at the same time, she was shivering, her body burning hot but still feeling cold.

Cassius's expression turned concerned as he sat down beside the bed. He began to wipe her sweat, using a cloth to gently pat her dry. The container he was using to catch her sweat was almost full, and he had to empty it several times throughout the night.

As he cared for Maledicta, Cassius couldn't help but feel a sense of tenderness towards her. He had always been drawn to her, despite her prickly exterior, and now, as he looked at her pale, dry face, he felt a surge of protectiveness towards her.

He held her hand, trying to share his body heat with her, and slowly but surely, she began to relax. Her shivering subsided, and her fever began to break.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Maledicta fell asleep, her chest rising and falling with a soft, gentle rhythm.

Cassius held her palm, staring at her pale, dry face. He couldn't help but think about what had happened earlier, about how Kaiden had run into the rain to save her.

A surge of anger boiled up inside him, and he felt his face grow hot with rage. Why did it have to be the human boy who had saved her? Why couldn't it have been him?

He had been with Maledicta for what felt like forever, and he had always been drawn to her. He was an alpha prince, and he knew that he was meant to be with her.

But Belladonna was his mate, and he didn't care about her. He only cared about Maledicta, and he would do anything to make her his.

He wouldn't let the human boy ruin things for him. He was going to find out what the boy was, and then he was going to get rid of him for good.

Cassius's hand moved to Maledicta's cheeks, his fingers tracing the contours of her face. He closed his eyes, imagining them making out, his fingers brushing against her lips. He open his eyes and stare at her lips.

The lips looked so tempting, so red and attractive. Cassius felt himself leaning in, his lips inches from Maledicta's.

But just as he was about to kiss her, Maledicta's eyes suddenly snapped open. Cassius flew backward, his body moving with a speed and agility. He quickly balanced himself, preventing himself from hitting the wall. Maledicta sprang up from the bed, her eyes wild and disoriented.

"What am I doing here?" she asked, looking around the room in confusion.

Cassius smiled, trying to appear nonchalant. "I saved you in the rain," he said. 

"I couldn't take you to your room because of the shield at your door, so I brought you here. You were sick, so I took care of you throughout the night." He said.

Maledicta's expression turned cold, her eyes narrowing. 

"Next time, you can drop me at my door." She said and started leaving.

Cassius's smile faltered, but he quickly regained his composure. 

"Not even a thank you?I couldn't sleep all night because of you." He said while going after her.

Maledicta ignored him and went out of his room  Cassius watched her go and smiled to himself.

As he turned and walked back to his room, Belladonna emerged from her hiding place, her eyes fixed on Maledicta's departing back.

Her heart was rising and falling with anger, her eyes blazing with a fierce and burning hatred. 

"I hate her so much," she spat, her teeth gritted in rage.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she quickly blinked them away. She wouldn't cry, not now, not ever. she turn off toward the opposite direction.
.

.

          THE NEXT DAY 

Kaiden stood in front of Maledicta's door, his eyes scanning the empty corridor. He had been waiting for what felt like an eternity.

Just as he was starting to wonder if Maledicta was even in her room, her voice cut through the silence. 

"What did you want?" she asked, her tone neutral.

Kaiden turned to face her, a smile spreading across his face as he took in her pale face.

"How are you feeling?" he asked, his eyes locked on hers as he walked closer.

Maledicta didn't respond, her eyes fixed on Kaiden's face as if trying to read his thoughts. She was sure she had seen him last night, had felt his warm arms around her as the thunderstorm raged on.

Kaiden's hand reached out, his fingers brushing against her forehead as if checking for a fever. Maledicta's eyes fluttered closed, her heart racing at the gentle touch.

"Next time it rains, you should stay indoors," Kaiden said, his voice soft with concern.

Maledicta's eyes snapped open, "Staying indoors is nothing," she snapped. "I'll still be struck."

Kaiden's face fell, his eyes filled with a deep sadness. "I'm sorry," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I didn't know."

 "It's not your fault," she said.

Kaiden took a deep breath, his eyes locked on Maledicta's.

 "I'll come to your room anytime something like that happens, I will protect you” he said.

 "And who are you to make that promise?" she asked blankly.

“I am Someone who owes you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

 "You brought me here, that's all I can do to return the favor" he added.

 "So you don't want to know why I brought you here anymore?" she asked. She couldn't believe she was actually having conversation with him.

"I don't care anymore, I love it here." He said.

 "Good for you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

She turned and opened her door, a clear dismissal. Kaiden nodded, his face falling.

"Take care of yourself," he said, his voice soft, before turning and running off down the corridor.

Maledicta watched him go, a small smile playing on her lips. She felt a strange sense of warmth in her chest, a feeling she couldn't quite explain.

As she turned to go back into her room, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Her eyes were shining, her face flushed with a soft pink glow.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her expression skeptical. What was happening to her?.
.
.
.
.

Aka stepped out of the Mistress's office, Benedicta by her side. The warm sunlight cast a golden glow over the school's courtyard, and the sound of laughter and chatter filled the air.

"Why are you just coming to school?" Benedicta asked, a smile playing on her lips. "Others resumed a week ago."

Aka shrugged,  "I traveled. I just returned home, and I hope I'm not too late." She said.

Benedicta's smile widened. "You're not. You're going to enjoy this school."

Aka grinned, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "I know that. It's going to be fun."

As they walked through the courtyard, Benedicta pointed out various landmarks and buildings. Aka listened intently, her eyes drinking in every detail.

Finally, they stopped in front of a door. 

"This is your room," Benedicta said, her smile warm.

Aka's eyes lit up as she pushed open the door. "Thank you so much," she said.

 "You're welcome. Tell me if you need anything, and you can also ask me any questions. You are Aka right" Benedicta asked.

Aka nodded, her eyes locked on Benedicta's. 

"Your smile looks fake," Aka said suddenly with a frown.

Benedicta's smile slowly disappeared, and she looked at Aka with a mixture of surprise and wariness.

 "What do you mean?" she asked.

"I'm just joking."Aka laughed.

Benedicta's expression relaxed, and she smiled again. "Oh, I should go."

As Benedicta walked away, Aka watched her with a calculating gaze. 

"She may be useful," she muttered to herself.

She stepped into her room, her eyes scanning the space with a critical gaze. The room was small but cozy, with a single bed and a desk in the corner.

Aka smiled to herself,  "Now let the fun begin," she said.She closed her eyes, her lips moving as she whispered a series of words. The air around her seemed to shimmer and distort, and then a group of demons appeared before her.

They were twisted and deformed, their bodies a mass of writhing, pulsing flesh. One of them had eyes that glowed like embers, while another had a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth.

Aka's smile grew wider as she gazed at the demons. 

"Now, spread out in the school and destroy their lives," she said, her voice dripping with malice.

The demons bowed, their twisted bodies contorting in ways that seemed impossible. And then they vanished, disappearing into the shadows like ghosts.

Aka laughed, her eyes gleaming with excitement. 

"Now, I have to get close to that witch," she said.

She lay down on her bed, a smile still playing on her lips. She knew that it wouldn't be easy, but she was determined to get what she wanted.

And what she wanted was chaos.
.
.
.
.

Kaiden opened the door and he was surprised to see Benedicta standing at the door, a bright smile on her face.

"Hey," Kaiden said, returning her smile.

"Are you ready for the outing?" Benedicta asked.

Kaiden nodded, "Sure."

Benedicta's smile grew wider. "I should take you to the lake today. Everyone love it” Benedicta said and he nodded.

As they walked side by side through the forest, Benedicta couldn't help but notice how handsome Kaiden looked. His hair was tied back in a ponytail, and his eyes sparkled with a warm, golden light.

They walked in silence for a while, the only sound being the rustling of leaves beneath their feet. Finally, they emerged from the forest and caught sight of the lake.

Kaiden's eyes widened in amazement. The lake was stunning, its waters sparkling clean and warm. A small beach lined the shore, and a few students were lounging in the sun, soaking up its warm rays.

Benedicta smiled, noticing Kaiden's reaction. "I told you it was beautiful."

Kaiden nodded, feeling a sense of wonder. "It's amazing."

They sat down beside the lake, sticking their legs into the warm water. Kaiden closed his eyes, feeling the sun's warm rays on his face.

After a few moments of silence, Benedicta spoke up. "I saw you yesterday."

Kaiden's eyes snapped open, and he turned to face her. "What do you mean?"

Benedicta's expression turned serious. "I saw you run into the rain to save Maledicta. That was so brave."

Kaiden's face fell, and he looked away, feeling a sense of embarrassment. "I just couldn't bear to watch her suffer," he muttered.

 "How did you feel when Cassius took her away?" Benedicta asked curiously.

"I was just sad a little that he didn't trust me, and mad that he couldn't come forward to save her. But that wasn't his fault." Kaiden said.

Benedicta nodded, "He's just jealous because he likes her." She said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "He does?"

Benedicta nodded. "Everyone knows. I think they'll get married too. His father is the alpha of the Crescent Moon Pack. They're very powerful. If Maledicta can marry him, they could help with her... condition." Benedicta said.

Kaiden's face fell, and he stood up, feeling a sense of restlessness.

 "That's good. I think I'll go now." He said.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed in surprise. "But why? We just got here." She asked.

Kaiden forced a smile. "I'm just tired all of a sudden. See you later." He said and with that, he turned and ran off, leaving Benedicta watching him go with mixed emotions.
.

               NIGHTTIME

Maledicta tossed and turned on her bed, her mind racing with thoughts she couldn't shake. She hadn't been able to sleep in years, not since the voices had started. They were always there, whispering in her ear, driving her mad.

But tonight, it wasn't just the voices that were keeping her awake. It was him.  The way he had touched her forehead that morning, the way he had made her feel... it was all so new and strange to her.

She had never thought about someone this much before. She had never felt this way before.

"Call him," a voice whispered in her head.

"Not like I know his name."Maledicta scoffed.

"It's Kaiden."The voice whispered again.

"Kaiden." Maledicta muttered the name to herself, feeling a shiver run down her spine. 

She slapped herself, trying to snap out of it.

 "What are you doing? Snap out of it," she told herself.

But it was no use. She couldn't shake the feeling that Kaiden had left on her.

She turned to the other side, trying to get comfortable, but as soon as she did, she found herself in Kaiden's arms. His hand was wrapped around her waist, holding her close.

Maledicta's eyes widened in shock as she wondered how Kaiden had gotten into her bed. She tried to release herself, but Kaiden's grip was tight.

She struggled for a few minutes, but eventually, she gave up. She lay there, staring at Kaiden's sleeping face.

He was handsome, she found herself thinking. His features were strong and chiseled, his lips soft and inviting.

Maledicta's heart beat loudly in her chest as she gazed at Kaiden. She felt a flutter in her stomach, a feeling she had never experienced before.

As she lay there, she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to kiss Kaiden. To feel his lips on hers, to taste his mouth.

The thought sent a shiver down her spine, and Maledicta felt herself getting lost in the fantasy.

As the night wore on, Maledicta found herself drifting off to sleep, Kaiden's arms wrapped tightly around her.

             THE NEXT DAY

Kaiden slowly opened his eyes, groggily taking in his surroundings. He was met with an unfamiliar room, the darkness making it difficult for him to see. He rubbed his eyes, trying to clear the haze.

As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he realized that he wasn't in his own room. Panic set in as he tried to remember how he had gotten there. He tried to stand up, but something was holding him down.

That's when he realized someone was sleeping on his shoulder. He gasped as he saw Maledicta's face, her eyes closed in sleep. He quickly pushed her away, standing up from the bed.

"What am I doing here?" he asked, his voice shaking slightly.

Maledicta stirred, opening her eyes to gaze up at Kaiden. 

"I should be the one asking you that question," she muttered. "You suddenly showed up in my room last night. I tried to wake you up, but you didn't budge."

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "How is that even possible?" He asked in confusion.

 "I was in shock too," she said. 

"You're human, right? So, how did you...do it?"  She asked with raise eyebrows.

 "What are you talking about?" Kaiden asked.

    “You suddenly appear in my room” She said.

"You called him to your room, you called his name last night, remember?”A voice whisper to her  But she shrugged it off, not wanting to believe it.

Kaiden looked down at the floor, his face flushing with shame. "I'm sorry, I must have sleepwalked."

 "Just leave." Maledicta said coldly.

Kaiden turned to leave, but suddenly stopped.

 "How did you manage to sleep in a room like this?" he asked, his eyes scanning the dark, dingy space.

Maledicta's eyes snapped up, her expression defensive. "What are you talking about?"

Kaiden gestured to the room. "When I woke up this morning, I thought I was being buried alive. This is not a nice place, it's dark and creepy. I think it would be cool to make some adjustments." He said.

Maledicta's face twisted in a scowl. "You can't tell me what to do, just get out." She snapped.

Kaiden shrugged, a small smile playing on his lips. "Have a nice day, then." He said.

He turned and left the room, leaving Maledicta to her thoughts. She lay back in bed, her mind racing with questions.

"Did I really call him here last night?" she wondered, a sense of frustration building inside her.

She groaned, throwing her arm over her eyes. She didn't know what was going on, but she knew she didn't like it.
.
.
.

Kaiden walked through the corridor, lost in thought. He was still trying to process the events of the previous night, and how he had ended up in Maledicta's bed.

As he turned a corner, he heard a voice behind him. "Where are you coming from?"

Kaiden turned to see Benedicta standing behind him, a look of curiosity on her face.

"Hey Benedicta, good morning," Kaiden said, trying to sound cheerful.

But Benedicta didn't return his greeting. Instead, she narrowed her eyes and said, "You didn't answer my question."

Kaiden hesitated, unsure of how to respond. He didn't want to lie to Benedicta, but he also didn't want to tell her the truth - that he had somehow magically ended up in Maledicta's bed.

"I went to see a senior," Kaiden said finally, trying to sound nonchalant. "I'm on my way back."

 "I saw you coming out of my sister's room," she said.

Kaiden's heart sank. He had been afraid of this. "About that..." he started to say, but Benedicta cut him off.

"Don't tell me you slept in her room," she shouted, her voice echoing off the walls.

Kaiden winced, feeling a surge of embarrassment. "Can you keep your voice down?" he whispered, looking around nervously.

But Benedicta was beyond reason. "I told you Cassius likes her," she said, her voice trembling with anger. 

"You must really hate your life because he is capable of killing you. I'm so disappointed in you” she said.

"It wasn't like that,It's complicated” he said, trying to explain. 

But Benedicta just shook her head.

 "I don't want to hear it," she said, turning and stalking off down the corridor.

Kaiden watched her go, feeling a mix of emotions. 

As he continued on his way, Kaiden couldn't help but wonder why Benedicta had looked so angry. He knew that she was protective of her sister, but he hadn't realized that she felt so strongly about it.

"Sorry," a voice said as Ryder was suddenly bumped into, the book he was holding flying out of his hands.

Ryder bent down to pick up the book, noticing that an intricately embroidered handkerchief had also fallen to the ground. He picked it up, admiring the beautiful stitching before looking up to see the owner of the handkerchief hurrying away.

Ryder quickly tucked the book under his arm and took off after the girl, weaving through the crowded corridors. He finally caught up to her just as she was about to turn a corner, grabbing her shoulder to stop her.

But instead of turning around, the girl suddenly spun around, using Ryder's momentum against him. She grabbed his arm and flipped him over her shoulder, sending Ryder crashing to the ground.

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise as he found himself staring up at the girl, who was now standing over him, a dagger pointed directly at his eyes.

"What did you want?" The girl asked coldly.

 “i just want to give you something” he said while trying to keep his voice steady as he slowly moved the dagger away from his face.

The girl's eyes narrowed, but she slowly lowered the dagger, her gaze never leaving Ryder's face. 

"You dropped this," Ryder said quickly, holding out the handkerchief.

 "I just wanted to give it back to you." He added.

The girl's expression softened, and she sheathed her dagger, standing up and offering Ryder a hand up. Ryder took it, dusting himself off as he stood up.

"I am so sorry,I thought you were something else."the girl said, bowing her head.

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise as the girl's long, dark hair fell forward, covering her face, she looks so beautiful. 

"It's nothing,I shouldn't have touched you like that." Ryder quickly said.

The girl chuckled, pushing her hair back behind her ear. 

"I'm actually new here,I'm Aka." she said, a mischievous glint in her eye.

Ryder's eyes locked onto hers, and he felt a sudden jolt of attraction.

 "I'm Ryder I could show you around if you want."he said, trying to sound casual.

Aka's smile faltered for a moment before she replied, "Sorry, but someone already took that spot."

Ryder's face fell, but he tried to hide his disappointment. 

"Oh, too bad. See you around then." He said before leaving.

Aka smirked, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Yeah, see you."

"I should get him wrapped around my finger,he could be useful too."she muttered to herself while watching him leave.

As she walked, Aka's gaze fell on the handkerchief, which she had tucked into her pocket. For a moment, her expression changed, a flicker of something like sadness or longing crossing her face.

But it was quickly replaced by her usual confident smirk. Aka tucked the handkerchief deeper into her pocket and continued on her way.

The students were having the time of their lives, laughing and chatting as they walked around the school. The morning lessons had just ended, and while some students had retired to their rooms, others were sticking around, enjoying the warm sunshine and each other's company.

Benedicta was busy showing Aka around the school, taking her to all the hidden nooks and crannies that only a few students knew about. Aka's eyes were wide with wonder as she took in the sights and sounds of the school.

"Your school is just so amazing," Aka breathed out.

Benedicta smiled, "Yeah, I love it too," she said.

As they walked, they suddenly caught sight of Kaiden, who was standing among a group of students, regaling them with stories of his world. The students were laughing and listening with rapt attention, and Kaiden's face was alight with excitement.

"Who is that?" Aka asked, her eyes fixed on Kaiden with a curious expression.

Benedicta smiled, her eyes also fixed on Kaiden. "He's a friend," she said softly.

Aka's eyes never left Kaiden's face. "What's his name?" she asked, her voice full of curiosity.

But before Benedicta could answer, Kaiden suddenly looked up, his eyes locking onto Benedicta's. He smiled, and started walking towards them, Ryder following close behind.

"I'm sorry for this morning," Kaiden said, his eyes fixed on Benedicta's. "Okay, it wasn't my fault, I don't..."

Benedicta smiled,  "It's okay, maybe I overreacted in the morning too." She said cutting him off.

Kaiden's face lit up with relief. "So you're not angry with me anymore?" he asked, his eyes hopeful.

Benedicta nodded, her smile widening. "No, I'm not." She said.

Kaiden smile and  looked at Aka, who was still staring at him with a curious expression. 

"Meet a friend," Benedicta said, pointing to Aka. "She's new here."

Aka's eyes never left Kaiden's face. "Hey," she said, her voice soft.

Kaiden muttered a greeting, feeling uncomfortable under Aka's intense gaze. 

“I  am Aka” she said and grabbed his hand.

 “Kaiden” he muttered while trying to release himself from her strong grip.

  “Nice name, you are  handsome too” she said.

    “Thanks” Kaiden said and release himself, Benedicta was already glaring dagger at Aka but she quickly change it to a smile when Kaiden look at her.

    “Bye” Kaiden said to her before leaving.

Ryder waved at Aka, who returned the wave with a smile.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on Aka. 

"You know him?" she asked, her voice neutral.

Aka's eyes flicked to Benedicta's. "We met earlier today,Is anything wrong?" She asked.

Benedicta's smile faltered, and she looked away, her eyes fixed on Kaiden's retreating back. 

"You just look like the kind of person who wouldn't want to be seen with someone like him,(Ryder)" she said gently.

Aka's eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on Benedicta's.

 "You must be wrong about me then," she said coldly.

Benedicta's smile returned, but it was tinged with a hint of malice. "We'll see about that."

Just then, a loud bell sounded, and students started running towards a direction. 

"What's wrong?" Aka asked, her eyes fixed on the rushing students.

"It's the emergency alarm," she said. "I guess something's wrong." She said.

Aka's eyes flicked to Benedicta's. "I guess I should go then,See you later." Aka said 
And with that, she turned and ran off, leaving Benedicta watching her go with her smile slowly disappearing.

Kaiden and Ryder walked into the large hall, filled with students who were all chatting and laughing. But as they entered, the atmosphere changed, and the students fell silent.

"What's wrong?" Kaiden asked curiously, scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

Ryder shrugged. "I don't know, let's watch."

As they waited, Mistress Morwen appeared at the top of the hall, flanked by Cassius and Thane. They were pushing two wooden carts behind them, and Kaiden's eyes widened as he saw what was inside.

The carts were filled with bodies, six in total, three in each cart. The students murmured in confusion, and Kaiden felt a shiver run down his spine.

Mistress Morwen raised her hands, and the room fell silent. 

"These bodies were discovered in private places around the school," she announced, her voice somber.

The students gasped, and Kaiden felt a surge of fear. What was going on?

Mistress Morwen continued, "We were shocked to find them, and after I checked, I realized they all had a mark on their back."

Cassius and Thane carried one of the bodies forward, and Mistress Morwen pulled back the cloth to reveal a deep, dark mark on the body's back.

"This mark shows that they were possessed by a demon named Saa,He possesses his victims and makes them commit suicide." Mistress Morwen explained.

The students gasped again, and Kaiden felt a wave of horror wash over him. A demon? Possessing people and making them kill themselves?

Mistress Morwen's expression turned serious. "I called you all here to tell you that the demon hasn't been found yet. He's still roaming around the school, looking for his next victim." She said.

Kaiden felt a chill run down his spine. They had to find this demon before it was too late.

"Saa is a very tricky demon,He can use a lot of things against you, so you all have to be careful." Mistress Morwen warned.

The students nodded, their faces pale with fear.

"I want you all to go to your rooms and lock your doors,Avoid private places like the forest or the garden, and don't go anywhere alone." Mistress Morwen instructed.

The students nodded again.

 "I and the seniors will find the demon. And get rid of him before tomorrow morning." She said and Cassius and Thane left with the bodies.

Mistress Morwen turned back to the students.

 "If you can't stay alone in your room, you can stay with a friend. I just want you all to be safe." She said.

“Okay Mistress” the  students nodded once more. 

 "Now, hurry up and go to your rooms! And remember, lock your doors and stay safe!" She said.

The students rushed out of the hall, eager to get to the safety of their rooms. Kaiden and Ryder followed.

As they walked, Ryder turned to Kaiden. "Should I stay with you in your room?" He asked.

Kaiden shook his head. "Don't worry, I'll be okay." He said.

Ryder nodded. "See you tomorrow then."

Kaiden nodded back, and they parted ways, each heading to their own room.

As Kaiden entered his room, he locked the door behind him and leaned against it, his heart still racing with fear. A demon was loose in the school, and he had to be careful, he quickly lay on the bed and cover himself with the blanket.
.
.
.

Kaiden's eyes snapped open, and he sat up in bed, his heart racing. He had just had the most terrifying nightmare of his life. In the dream, he had seen a young boy being thrown into a burning fire by a mob of angry people.

The boy's screams still echoed in Kaiden's mind as he tried to catch his breath. He had never experienced a nightmare like that before, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of dread that lingered inside him.

As he tried to calm himself down, he suddenly heard a voice calling out his name. "Kaiden."

His eyes snapped open, and he recognized the voice immediately. It was his father's voice. 

Kaiden's heart skipped a beat as he threw off his covers and got out of bed. He rushed to the window and pulled back the curtains, and his eyes widened in shock as he saw his father standing outside, smiling at him.

"Dad!" Kaiden exclaimed, his voice shaking with excitement. He hasn't saw him when suddenly vanished about five years ago.

His father beckoned him to come outside, and without thinking twice, Kaiden rushed out of his room.

   “Father what are You doing here?” He asked.

    “I have something important to show you, follow me” he said and started leaving, Kaiden followed his father into the night still wondering why he was suddenly in this world.

As they walked towards the forest, Kaiden's excitement turned to confusion, he suddenly stopped moving and turn to his father.

“Where are going?” He asked.

   “We will get there soon” the man said and he hesitated before following him. They enter the big forest and he suddenly stop again.

But before he could ask any questions, his father stopped and turned to him. And that was when Kaiden saw it - the man's eyes had changed. They were no longer his father's eyes, but something dark and sinister.

"You're not my father, are you?" Kaiden asked, his voice trembling with fear.

The man laughed maniacally, and his body began to transform. His skin turned a dark, scaly gray, and his eyes multiplied, covering his entire face.

"I am Saa, the demon," the creature hissed, its voice like a snake slithering through the grass.

Kaiden tried to run, but his feet felt heavy, as if they were rooted to the spot. Saa started to move closer, its eyes fixed on Kaiden with an unspeakable hunger.

Just as he was about to touch him, three arrows shot out of nowhere, hitting Saa with deadly precision. The demon let out a high-pitched scream as it stumbled backwards, its body beginning to burn.

Kaiden watched in horror as Saa disintegrated into nothingness, its screams echoing through the forest.

As he turned to run, he felt a hand on his shoulder. 

"Are you okay?" Benedicta asked, her eyes scanning his face with concern.

Kaiden nodded, still trying to process what had just happened. 

"Thank you for saving me," he said, his voice shaking with gratitude.

Benedicta smiled and hugged him tightly. 

"I'll always be there to protect you," she whispered.

As they hugged, Aka watched from a nearby tree, her eyes blazing with anger. She was holding a bow and arrow, and she had been the one to shoot one of the arrows that hit Saa.

Maledicta was also watching from a distance, her eyes fixed on Kaiden and Benedicta. She was holding a bow and arrow, and it was her arrow that had set Saa on fire. She turned and disappeared into the night, her expression unreadable.

              (NERVOUS)

Mistress Morwen walked into Maledicta's room, her eyes widening in surprise. The room was spotless, with not a single speck of dust or dirt in sight. The walls, which were once a dull gray, were now a bright, sunny yellow, and there were intricate, beautiful designs etched into the walls.

"Wow, it's really true," Mistress Morwen said, her voice full of wonder. "You've finally cleaned up your room."

Maledicta looked up from the book she was reading, a scowl on her face.

 "What's it to you?" she muttered.

Mistress Morwen smiled,"I'm just happy, that's all." She said.

"Can't I do what I like anymore?"Maledicta scoffed, rolling her eyes.

Mistress Morwen chuckled, her eyes never leaving Maledicta's face. "I'm happy for this new change in you," she said, her voice sincere.

 "Nothing's changed," she spat. "No one can ever change me."

Mistress Morwen's smile never wavered. "We'll see about that,It looks like your sister likes him too." She said.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her face darkening. “

I don't care about that, They can be together for all I care."she said coldly.

 "Are you sure?" Mistress Morwen asked calmly.

Maledicta's face twisted in anger. "Mum, just leave," she spat.

Mistress Morwen's face lit up with a wide smile.

 "I can't believe you called me mom, I've been waiting for years to hear that." She said.

Maledicta's expression didn't change.

"I know that boy is special," Mistress Morwen said, her voice serious. "I did some checking on him, and he's an ordinary human, but he may still be your helper. You shouldn't let him go, Maledicta. Please don't lose him."

Maledicta didn't respond, but Mistress Morwen could see the wheels turning in her mind. She knew that Maledicta was intrigued by Kaiden, and she was determined to make sure that Maledicta didn't let him slip away.

As Mistress Morwen left the room, Maledicta couldn't help but think about what her mother had said. She knew that Kaiden was special, but she had no idea just how special he was.

She thought back to the previous night, when she had seen Kaiden hugging Benedicta tightly. She had felt a pang of jealousy, but she had quickly pushed it aside.

 Maledicta stood up and walked over to the mirror. She stared at her reflection, her eyes scanning her face and hair.

She touched her face, her fingers tracing the contours of her cheeks and jawline. She couldn't help but think who's more prettier between her and her sister, she slapped herself and snapped out of the silly thought.

Kaiden heard a voice calling from his door and went to open it and Aka standing there, a bright smile on her face.

Before he could even greet her, she pushed past him and entered his room. 

"You have a nice room," she said, looking around with interest.

Kaiden closed the door behind her, feeling a bit uneasy.

 "What are you doing here?" he asked calmly, trying to hide his surprise.

Aka sat down on his bed, making herself at home. 

"To see you, of course. Aren't we friends?" she asked.

Kaiden raised an eyebrow. "We are, but I don't think we've gotten to the extent of visiting each other's rooms." He said.

Aka laughed, a throaty sound that sent a shiver down Kaiden's spine. 

"It's nothing, we should start somewhere. And I really want to get to know you." She said.

Kaiden felt a bit uneasy, but he tried to brush it off. "How about we go outside and talk? It's a nice day." He asked.

Aka shook her head, her smile growing wider.

 "That wouldn't be fun. I like it better here. Let's have some fun." She said and lay on bed.

“You can't be doing this” Kaiden said and grabbed her arm to dragged her up from the bed.

  “I love it here” she said with a smirk and before Kaiden could react, Aka suddenly dragged him closer, and he lost his balance, falling onto the bed. Aka started to climb on top of him, but Kaiden pushed her away.

"What are you doing?" he asked, trying to sit up, but Aka was using her power to hold him down.

Aka's smile grew wider, and she started to caress his cheeks. "I'm just having fun. Don't you enjoy it?"

Kaiden just glared at her, feeling angry and helpless.  He tried to move but couldn't.

"Surprisingly, I just liked you the moment I saw you,Your smile, your face, your features... I want you. And I always get what I want, even if that means cheating on the man I've been waiting for like forever." She said with a smirk.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock as Aka leaned in closer, her lips inches from his. He tried to struggle, but Aka's power was too strong.

Just as Aka was about to kiss him, Ryder's voice cut through the air. "Kaiden, you won't believe this!" he exclaimed, entering the room.

But he stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes widening in surprise as he took in the scene before him. Aka quickly got off Kaiden and smiled innocently at Ryder.

"See you later," she said to Kaiden, before walking over to Ryder.

 "I'll visit you tomorrow. He's so boring, I'm sure you're more fun." She whispered to Ryder with that, she pecked Ryder on the cheek, leaving him looking stunned and confused.

Ryder walked up to Kaiden, a look of concern etched on his face. "What was that?" he asked, his voice low.

 "I don't know what's wrong with her," he said, frowning. "She suddenly showed up and started acting weird. Nothing happened between us, though."

"She's different, Kaiden. I'm getting some weird feelings anytime I'm with her." He said with a smile.

Kaiden raised an eyebrow. "I hope it's not what I'm thinking?" he said, a grin spreading across his face.

Ryder chuckled. "Let's forget about that for now. There's something I wanted to tell you."he said.

"What is it?" Kiaden asked.

"There's a visiting period at the end of this week." He said.

"Visiting? What do you mean?"Kaiden's eyes widened. 

Ryder smiled. "Once in a while, we're given three days to visit our families. And this time, it coincides with the celebration of the Goddess." He said.

Kaiden's face fell. "But I have no one here."

Ryder clapped him on the back. "Don't worry, you'll come with me. I'm sure you'll love it." He said.

  "But you have to disguise yourself. They can't know you're human, or..."

Kaiden's eyes widened in alarm. "Or what?"

Ryder hesitated before speaking. "Or you'll be burned to death."

Kaiden's face paled. "Now it's getting creepy."

"Don't worry, we'll sort it out. I just wanted to warn you so you can prepare yourself." He said.

Kaiden nodded, still trying to process the warning. Ryder stood up, a smile on his face.

"Hey, want to take your mind off things? There's a game going on, and I thought you might want to watch."

Kaiden's face lit up. "Of course I want to."

Ryder grinned. "Let's go then."

Together, they ran out of the room.
.
.
.

Belladonna was walking down the corridor, her long, dark hair swaying behind her. She was lost in thought, As she turned a corner, she saw Cassius coming from the other direction. She stopped in her tracks, her eyes fixed on him. But to her surprise, Cassius didn't even acknowledge her presence. He simply walked past her, his eyes fixed on some point ahead.

Belladonna's eyes narrowed, her heart stinging with hurt. She quickly caught up to him, her voice calling out to him.

 "My dad wants you to visit him at the palace during the period of visit." She said.

Cassius stopped and turned to her, "Tell him I'm not interested." He said.

Belladonna's eyes widened in shock. How could he be so cruel? Didn't he care about her feelings at all? "Till when will you continue to be like this?" she asked, her voice shaking with emotion. 

"It wasn't my fault that I'm your mate, and I couldn't help but feel connected to you because of our bond. You're hurting me." She cried.

Cassius's expression didn't change. He simply shrugged and turned to leave. 

"Get rid of that hurt,I rejected you already, but you didn't accept my rejection because of your selfishness. I told you I don't love you, and I never will." He muttered.

Belladonna's eyes blazed with anger and hurt. How could he say such cruel things to her? Didn't he know how much she loved him? "Why?" she yelled, her voice echoing off the walls. "Just why? She hasn't even given you a chance, and you make me hate her. You turn me into a monster." She said.

Cassius stopped and turned to her, his eyes flashing with anger. "I didn't make you do that,You brought it upon yourself. All you have to do is accept my rejection. I won't see your father, and don't come to visit my parents either." He snapped.

Belladonna's face twisted with rage and hurt. "I'll make Maledicta suffer," she hissed. "I'll hurt her because of you."

Cassius shrugged, his expression unchanging. "Good luck to you then."

He turned to leave, but Belladonna quickly grabbed his arm. "Please, listen to me," she begged. "I..."

But Cassius wasn't interested. He snatched his arm out of her grasp, and Belladonna fell to the ground, her palms scraping against the stone floor.

Cassius didn't even look back. He simply kept walking, leaving Belladonna to pick herself up.

As she sat on the ground, staring at her scraped palms, Just as she was about to give in to her tears, Belladonna felt a pair of arms lift her off the ground. She looked up to see Thane.

"What are you doing?" Belladonna asked, trying to struggle out of his grasp.

Thane held her firmly. "My brother hurt you," he said. "This is all I can do to help."

Belladonna's eyes flashed with anger. "I didn't ask for your help," she snapped. "Drop me this instant."

Thane sighed, his expression softening. "Stop being stubborn and just accept it."

But Belladonna was beyond reason. She struggled and kicked, trying to get out of Thane's grasp. But he held her firmly, his arms like steel bands around her.

Finally, Belladonna's strength gave out, and she slumped against Thane's chest, tears streaming down her face. Thane held her close, his arms wrapping around her like a warm blanket.
.

.

Maledicta suddenly appeared behind a tree, her eyes fixed on Kaiden as he played with a group of boys. They were playing a game that looked like a mix of soccer and rugby, and Kaiden was struggling to keep up.

The voice in her head had told her to come here, and she had obeyed without question. Now, as she watched Kaiden stumble and fall, she felt a pang of... something. She wasn't sure what it was, but it felt almost like concern.

One of the opposing team members sneered at Kaiden. "If you all want to have fun in this game, he should be gone."

"We are having fun, just try and win."Ryder scoffed.

Kaiden looked embarrassed, but he spoke up. "I could leave, I know I'm holding you guys down."

Ryder clapped him on the back. "Don't, this game is just to have fun, okay?"

But just as it seemed like Kaiden was going to give up, he suddenly started playing with a newfound energy. He dodged and weaved around the other players, his movements swift and agile.

The other players were shocked as Kaiden scored goal after goal, leading his team to victory. 

"How did you do it?" Ryder asked, grinning at Kaiden in amazement.

Kaiden shrugged, looking just as surprised. "I don't know too."

Maledicta watched from behind the tree, a small smile playing on her lips. She had been the one to help Kaiden win, using her powers to guide him and give him an edge.

But as she watched Kaiden's team carry him on their shoulders in celebration, her smile faltered. She realized that her powers had worked on Kaiden, even though they hadn't worked on him just a week ago.

She didn't understand why her powers were so unpredictable, or why they seemed to work on Kaiden now when they hadn't before.

Just as she was lost in thought, a voice snapped her out of it. "Hey."

Maledicta turned to see Aka standing behind her, a bright smile on her face.

"What?" Maledicta demanded, her voice cold.

Aka's smile faltered for a moment, but she recovered quickly.

 "I've noticed you're always alone, same with me too. We could become friends." She said.

Maledicta raised an eyebrow. "Why would I want to be friends with you?"

Aka shrugged. "I don't know, I just thought it would be nice to have someone to talk to. And I could teach you a lot of things." She said.

"I don't need your help." Maledicta snorted and started leaving, Aka followed her immediately.

Aka's smile never wavered. "Come on, I really want us to..."

But Maledicta cut her off, her voice cold and deadly. "Don't follow me."

Aka's smile faltered, but she didn't back down. "I'm not afraid of you," she said and Maledicta she reached out and grabbed Aka's neck, her fingers closing around it like a vice.

Aka's eyes widened in shock as Maledicta leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"If you don't stay away from me, you rotten demon, you will regret coming here." She muttered with gritted teeth.

Aka's face turned red as she struggled to breathe, but Maledicta just smiled and leaned in closer. 

"I know you don't want  that. I don't care about what you're doing here, just don't mess with me or you'll be roasted." She said.

Maledicta released Aka's neck and turned to leave, disappearing into the trees.

Aka stumbled backwards, gasping for air as she clutched at her neck. It felt like it was burning, and she could still feel Maledicta's fingers closing around it like a vice.

As she struggled to catch her breath, Aka's eyes narrowed. How did Maledicta know she was a demon?

She closed her eyes and began to chant, her voice low and hypnotic. The air around her began to shimmer and distort, and a group of demons appeared before her, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy.

Aka's smile grew wider as she opened her eyes and looked at the demons. 

"Follow her and punish her," she said, her voice dripping with malice.

The demons bowed their heads and vanished.

  “Let see how strong you are Maledicta” she chuckled but it quickly turn to a painful one as she  grab her neck in pain.
.
.
.
.

Maledicta walked through the forest, her senses on high alert. She could feel the presence of demons lurking nearby, and she knew they were after her.

Suddenly, a group of ten demons emerged from the trees, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy. They were big and muscular, with sharp claws and teeth.

Maledicta's expression remained cold and unyielding. She drew her sword, a gleaming black blade that seemed to absorb the light around it.

The demons charged at her, their claws swiping through the air. Maledicta dodged and weaved, her movements swift and agile.

She reached out with her powers, summoning a wave of dark energy that crashed into the demons. They stumbled back, momentarily stunned.

Maledicta took advantage of the distraction to strike, her sword slicing through the demons' defenses. She was a whirlwind of steel and shadow, her movements swift and deadly.

The demons tried to fight back, but Maledicta was too powerful. She summoned a storm of dark energy, unleashing a barrage of attacks that ripped through the demons' defenses.

One by one, the demons fell to the ground, dead. Maledicta stood over them, her chest heaving with exertion.

Her expression remained cold and unyielding, her eyes gleaming with a fierce intensity. She was a force to be reckoned with, and she knew it.

As she stood there, she felt a presence watching her. She turned to see Aka standing in the trees, a look of shock on her face.

Maledicta's gaze narrowed, her eyes flashing with a cold, calculating intensity. 

"You should have brought more demons," she said, her voice cold and detached.

Aka's face twisted with anger, but Maledicta just turned and walked away, leaving Aka to seethe with rage.

    “Those demons are among most powerful demons and no one as ever singlehandedly defeated them before.

    “I need to think of a better way to get her” Aka thought to herself while still looking so shock.
.
.
.

Kaiden groaned and stood up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. Someone was knocking at his door, and he wondered who it could be. He reached under his bed and pulled out the sword that Thane had given him, holding it at the ready as he approached the door.

He slowly opened the door, his heart pounding in his chest. But to his surprise, it wasn't a monster or a demon standing on the other side. It was Maledicta, her eyes gleaming in the dim light.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise as he drop the sword.

"What are you doing here?" he asked, trying to hide his confusion.

Maledicta stammered, her eyes darting back and forth. "I...just...I want to..." she trailed off, looking like she was struggling to find the right words. She couldn't believe she was nervous, this have never happened to her before, she is always bold.

 "You can tell me," Kaiden said with a smile.

"Can I...sleep in your room?" she suddenly asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden's eyes went wide with surprise. 

"What?" he asked, trying to process what she was asking.

Maledicta looked up at him, her eyes pleading. "I just really need to sleep right now, and a rain is about to start. You told me to stay with you when rain is about to fall." She said.

Kaiden's face went blank, and he just stared at her, unsure of what to say. He hadn't expected her to ask something like that, and he wasn't sure how to respond.

Maledicta's face fell, and she turned to leave. "This is stupid, I shouldn't have said that to you. Please forget that I said it."

But Kaiden quickly grabbed her hand and dragging her back inside. He closed the door behind her and leaned against it, his eyes locked on hers.

"I'd like that too," he said, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta's eyes widened in surprise, and she tried to pull her hand away. But Kaiden held tight, his fingers wrapping around her wrist like a vice.

He pulled her closer, his eyes burning with intensity.

 "I'd like you to sleep here," he said again.

Maledicta's face went pale, and she looked like she was about to faint. But Kaiden just smiled and scooped her up in his arms, carrying her over to the bed.

                    (I D K)

Kaiden smiled and moved closer to Maledicta. "We could share the bed, I'll just give you enough space," he said, trying to reassure her.

Maledicta didn't say anything, but she lay down beside him, her eyes fixed on his face. Kaiden could feel her gaze on him, but he didn't mind. He was used to her intense stare.

As they lay there, a loud thunderstorm rolled in, causing the sky to darken and the wind to pick up. Maledicta closed her eyes, her body tensing up with fear.

But Kaiden was there to comfort her. He moved closer, his body warm and reassuring. "See, you'll be okay," he said softly. "You don't have to worry."

Maledicta's body slowly relaxed, her tense muscles easing as she felt Kaiden's warmth. She opened her eyes.

Kaiden smiled and stroked her hair. "Are you feeling sleepy?" he asked.

Maledicta shook her head, her eyes never leaving his face.

"How about I tell you a story?" Kaiden offered, trying to distract her from the storm.

Maledicta didn't respond, but she didn't look away either. Kaiden took that as a sign to continue.

"I'll tell you about myself," he said, a sad smile spreading across his face.

 "I could remember waking up on a bed, I was ten then. I couldn't remember anything about my past, and till now, I haven't."

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her gaze intensifying as she listened to Kaiden's story.

"I saw a man who called himself my father, and he told me my mom left. But I learned ten years later that I actually killed my mom. I don't know how that happened, I don't know what I did to her."

Kaiden's voice cracked, and he paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.

"My dad got involved in gambling and always came home drunk. He lost his job and started borrowing loans. Then, two years ago, he suddenly disappeared. I don't know where to, I've been hunted by his loan sharks since then."

"I work a lot just to pay his loans off, but it seems like the loans keep increasing. I couldn't find a job because of those loan sharks following me around, they always threaten to kill me."

Kaiden's voice dropped to a whisper, his eyes filled with a deep sadness.

"I'm grateful you took me away from a place like that. I don't even know how to thank you, so I'll just continue to do my best." He said.

Maledicta's voice was barely above a whisper. "You did me a favor too."

 "I must have bored you out with my story." He smiled.

Maledicta shook her head, her eyes locked on his face. "You didn't. I'm glad you opened up to me."

Kaiden's smile faltered, and he looked away, trying to compose himself.

"I don't think my story will work, let's try a song," he said, trying to lighten the mood.

Maledicta closed her eyes, a soft smile spreading across her face. Kaiden began to sing, his voice low and soothing.

As he sang, Maledicta's mind felt at peace, the voices in her head quiet for once. She felt relieved, and before she knew it, she fell asleep.

Kaiden finished the song and smiled when he saw that Maledicta was already asleep. He covered her well and studied her face, his eyes tracing the contours of her features.

"She looks so pretty and innocent right now that people could misunderstand her as an angel," he chuckled.

He leaned down and pecked her forehead, his lips brushing against her skin. Maledicta stirred, moving closer to him.

Kaiden smiled and wrapped his arms around her, holding her close.

The school atmosphere was electric with excitement. Students were packing their bags and saying their goodbyes, eager to head home for the Nightshade Goddess festival. The air was filled with the sound of laughter and chatter, and the smell of freshly baked goods wafted through the corridors.

Kaiden stretched and yawned, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. He had slept soundly, without any of the gruesome nightmares that had been plaguing him lately. He looked beside him, expecting to see Maledicta, but she was already gone. She must have teleported, he thought, smiling to himself as he remembered their peaceful sleep.

He got out of bed and went to open the door and to his surprise, Benedicta was standing in the doorway, a bright smile on her face.

"I was just about to knock," she said, hugging him tightly as they entered the room together.

Kaiden laughed and hugged her back,  "What are you doing here this early?" he asked, slightly pushing her off.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. "I came to see you," she said. "We didn't see each other yesterday because I was busy. I missed you."

"Oh, I didn't even notice you weren't around," Kaiden said with a smile.

Benedicta's face fell, and for a moment, Kaiden thought he saw a flash of hurt in her eyes. But then she smiled, and the moment was gone.

"There's a lot of preparation going on," she said. "You're not supposed to be sleeping. You should pack your stuff too."

Kaiden nodded,He moved to his closet, Benedicta following close behind.

"You can follow me home," she said, smiling up at him. "Me, you, and my mom."

"I'm following Ryder already," he said. 

“Oh” she muttered sadly.

"What did you mean by you and your mom? What about Maledicta?" He asked.

"She can't go to the town," she said. "She hasn't been there since she was born. She was hated there because of the calamity her birth caused." He said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock. "Are you telling me she's never been to her hometown?" he asked, feeling a sense of outrage.

Benedicta nodded, her eyes downcast. "Right from where she was born, she's been in this school."

Kaiden's face twisted with anger. "That's unfair to her," he said.

"Yes, it's unfair, but you can't involve yourself with her, Kaiden. She's dangerous. I advise you to stay away." She said.

"She's not that bad,And I think it's about time people started understanding that." He said.

Benedicta's face twisted with anger, and for a moment, Kaiden thought he saw a flash of hatred in her eyes. "They'll never understand," she spat. "Because she'll never change."

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock. "She's your sister," he said.

Benedicta's face twisted with anger, and she yelled, "Yeah, that's why I'm honest, because I like her!"

She turned and stormed towards the door, but then she suddenly stopped, her eyes closing as if she was in pain. She suddenly a vision where Kaiden was on the bed and Aka was trying to climb him and kiss him, she can see vision of the past while Maledicta saw the future.

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked, taking a step forward.

But Benedicta didn't respond. She just stood there, her eyes closed, her face twisted in a mixture of pain and shock.

And then, in an instant, she was gone, storming out of the room without a word.

Kaiden was left standing there, feeling confused and worried. What had just happened? And what was wrong with Benedicta?.

Thane walked into his brother's room, a look of excitement on his face.

 "Are you ready? Our palanquin is already waiting," he said, his eyes scanning the room to make sure Cassius had everything he needed.

Cassius was packing a few last-minute items into his bag, his face focused on the task at hand.

 "I just have a few more things to pack," he said, not looking up.

Thane walked over to help his brother, Thane was born four months after Cassius, a surprise to their family, and as a result, Cassius was the older brother and the Alpha prince. He would inherit the title of Alpha after their father, and Thane had always looked up to him with a mix of admiration and reverence.

 "Brother, don't you think you're being unfair to Bella?" Thane suddenly asked.

Cassius's expression darkened, and he frowned deeply. "What are you talking about?" he growled.

 “I saw what happen between you both yesterday, You should treat her with more love and respect. You two will be getting married soon." He said.

“We're not getting married," he said, his voice dripping with disdain.

 "I'm going to tell Mum and Dad to cancel the marriage. I'm not interested."he scoffed.

Thane's eyes widened in shock, and he felt a surge of anger towards his brother. "But she's your mate!" he exclaimed. "What are you thinking?"

Cassius shrugged, his expression unyielding. "If you care so much about her, you can just marry her instead," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

 "You haven't found your mate yet, right? You can just pray to the Moon Goddess, who knows, she might give her to you." He said.

Thane felt a sting from his brother's words, but he tried to keep his cool. 

Cassius picked up his bag and walked out of the room, leaving Thane to follow him. They walked to the palanquin in silence.

As they approached the palanquin, Cassius dropped his bag inside and took off running, disappearing into the forest. Thane sighed and sat down in the palanquin, his heart heavy with worry.

Meanwhile, Cassius ran through the forest, his feet pounding against the earth. He finally arrived at a clearing and smiled when he saw Maledicta sitting on a rock, her eyes fixed on the ground.

"I knew you'd be here," he said, sitting down beside her. But Maledicta didn't even spare him a glance.

Cassius didn't seem to mind, though. He leaned back on his elbows and watched her, a small smile playing on his lips.

 "I'm going to town now, for the celebration," he said gently.

Maledicta finally looked up at him, her eyes narrowing. "Why are you telling me?" she asked coldly.

Cassius shrugged, his smile growing wider. "I could help you lift your curse," he said.

"All you have to do is agree to marry me. I'll pray to the Goddess, and she'll grant my wish as the future Alpha." He said.

Maledicta raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. "And why would I do that?" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain.

"You can send me a letter when you're ready," he said, standing up. "I'll be on my way."

And with that, he took off running, leaving Maledicta to watch him go. 

"Stupid," she muttered to herself.

Aka appeared in front of Queen Epusa with a smile

"Why was I called here?" she asked.

Queen Epusa smiled,. "I have the book where Lucan's power was sealed," she said.

Aka's eyes widened in shock as she approached her mother. 

"Wow, how did you get that?" she asked, her voice full of awe.

Queen Epusa's smile grew wider. "I snuck into the underworld, I almost died, and I lost a lot of energy. It will take months to recover." She said.

” it's awesome," Aka said while admiring the golden book.

Queen Epusa chuckled, "Yes, it was worth it," she said.

 "You see, there was a prophecy thousands of years ago that a boy would be born. He would be so powerful, and he would be our demon lord. He would destroy the world." Epusa started.

 "The people of Nightshade tried to stop it, but they weren't successful. Then, a woman was pregnant, and her husband and his dad hid it from people. The baby spent more than five hundred years in her belly, and when it was time to be born, he started manifesting cruel power."

Aka's eyes were glued to her mother's face, her expression rapt with attention.

Queen Epusa continued. "The grandfather wanted to save his grandson, and that's why he summoned sorcerers. Lucan's power was sealed into the 'Gold Book.' He was born as an ordinary human and faced a lot of bullying because Nightshade people hate humans."

"...and then one night, after something terrible happened, he suddenly disappeared," Epusa said.

"He is our only key to taking over the world. We have to find him, and you will marry him and reign beside him forever." She concluded her story.

Aka's brow furrowed in confusion. "How is this useful?" she asked while staring at the book.

Epusa's smile grew wider. "If the book is opened, his power will return to him, and he will come to us by himself." She said.

 "Then what are we waiting for?" Aka asked, reaching out to grab the book, she try to open it.

But as soon as she touched it, the book became scorching hot, forcing Aka to throw it away with a cry of pain.

Epusa's expression turned serious. "It can't be opened unless his blood is dropped on it." She said.

Aka's face twisted in frustration. "Where are we going to find him, then?" she demanded.

Epusa's smile returned, "There is another solution. That girl, Maledicta... if her blood is dropped on the book, it will open too." Epusa said.

"What are you talking about?" she asked.

"That girl is more special than you think. All you need to do is bring me a little drop of her blood." Queen Epusa said.

"Trust me, Mum, I will do anything I can," Aka said, before vanishing into thin air.

Epusa's smile grew wider as she slowly picked up the book from the ground, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.
.
.
.

Benedicta suddenly appeared beside Aka, her eyes narrowing as she gazed at her. 

"Where are you coming from?" she asked.

Aka turned to her, a smirk playing on her lips. "Somewhere important," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

 "What are you doing with Kaiden yesterday?" Benedicta demanded, her voice rising.

Aka's smirk grew wider. "Wow, are you stalking me now?" she asked, her voice mocking.

Benedicta's face twisted with rage. "Stay away from him," she warned, her voice cold and deadly.

Aka scoffed, her eyes rolling. "Why should I? You don't have the right to tell me that." She said.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger, and she suddenly reached out and grabbed a rope that was hanging from a nearby tree. She flung it around Aka's neck, pulling it tight.

Aka's eyes widened in shock as she stumbled backwards, her back hitting the tree trunk. She fell to the ground, gasping for air as Benedicta tightened the rope around her neck.

"If I ever see you with Kaiden again, I will kill you," Benedicta hissed, her eyes blazing with fury.

Aka's face turned red as she struggled to breathe, her eyes bulging out of their sockets. She tried to speak, but all that came out was a strangled gasp.

Benedicta released the rope, and Aka collapsed to the ground, gasping for air. She coughed and spluttered, her eyes streaming with tears.

As she looked up at Benedicta, Aka's eyes flashed with anger and hatred. 

"Witch," she cursed, her voice barely above a whisper.

Benedicta turned to leave, but not before casting a cold glance at Aka. 

"Remember, stay away from Kaiden, I am not nice and you know that" she warned, her voice dripping with malice.

Aka watched as Benedicta disappeared into the trees, her heart seething with anger and resentment. She knew that she had to be careful, that Benedicta was not someone to be underestimated.

Kaiden knocked gently on the door before opening it, Maledicta had just finished her bath, and her white hair was plastered to her body, making her look even more beautiful than usual.

Kaiden's eyes widened in admiration as he took in the sight of her. He felt a nervous smile spread across his face as he walked closer to her. 

"I'll be going soon," he said, trying to sound casual despite the butterflies in his stomach. "I just wanted to tell you."

Maledicta muttered a response, not even looking up at him as she walked over to her bed. "Have fun, then."

Kaiden's smile faltered for a moment, but he quickly recovered. He didn't want to leave her, not when she looked so beautiful and vulnerable. "I just don't like the idea of you staying in the school alone," he said, trying to sound convincing. "You'll be sad and bored."

Maledicta scoffed, rolling her eyes. "This isn't my first time, so stop overreacting."

He walked closer to her, his eyes locked on hers.

 "You could disguise yourself and come with me, I could stay if you want me to." He said.

"What are you doing this?" she asked while moving closer to him.

Kaiden's heart skipped a beat as he looked into her eyes. He felt like he was drowning in their depths, like he was being pulled under by a riptide. 

"I don't know," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

 "This is all weird to me. I just want you to be happy." He added.

Maledicta's eyes searched his face, as if looking for something. And then, to Kaiden's surprise, she didn't look away. She just kept looking at him, her eyes locked on his.

Kaiden felt his heart racing as he reached out to touch her cheek. She didn't stop him, just kept staring at him as he leaned in closer. He could feel her warm breath on his skin, and it sent shivers down his spine.

Maledicta's eyes fluttered closed and her lip pouted slightly.

             (I MISS YOU)

Kaiden smiled as he watched Maledicta pout, her lip jutting out in a cute expression. He was about to kiss her, but she had suddenly pulled away, leaving him feeling surprised and confused.

"We can't be doing this," she said, moving to sit on her bed. Kaiden kept looking at her, trying to understand why she had pushed him away.

"I'm sure your friend is waiting,Aren't you going anymore?" She said after sometime.

"Should I stay, then?" Kaiden asked, trying to sound casual.

Maledicta's expression turned cold. "Don't. You'll regret it." She said.

"Come with me, then,We'll figure something out. No one will find out." He said.

Maledicta shook her head, "Don't worry about me. Just have fun. I'm okay staying in the school."
He nodded, trying to look understanding, and turned to leave.

Kaiden made his way to the palanquin, where Ryder was already waiting for him.

 "Where did you go?" Ryder asked, looking at Kaiden with curiosity.

Kaiden shrugged, "Just somewhere. Don't ask."

Ryder raised an eyebrow, but he didn't push the issue. "Okay... but are you seeing someone?" he asked.

Kaiden groaned, feeling his face heat up. "I told you, no questions."

Ryder laughed, holding up his hands in surrender. "Okay, okay. I won't ask you anymore."

As the palanquin started moving, Kaiden couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. He had never been in a palanquin before, and he was looking forward to seeing the town.

 "This thing is amazing, isn't it?" he asked, gesturing to the palanquin.

Kaiden nodded, his eyes wide with wonder. "Yeah, it's incredible. I've never seen anything like it."

Ryder chuckled, looking pleased with himself. "Yeah, it's one of a kind. Only my family owns one like it in the whole town."

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Your father must be rich, then."

Ryder shrugged, looking nonchalant. "I could say that."

As they rode in silence for a moment, Ryder suddenly pulled out a small, golden pill. 

"What's that?" Kaiden asked, his curiosity piqued.

Ryder handed him the pill. "Mistress Morwen told me to give it to you. It'll make you look like one of us for a few days."

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Why do I need to take that?" He asked while pointing at the pill.

"Because our people can't know you're human. It's not safe." Ryder said.

As he took the pill,he turned to Ryder, his eyes curious. 

"Why do your people hate humans so much?" he asked.

"Humans are betrayers,"Ryder said.

 "We lived together with humans thousands of years ago," he began. 

"We made them our kings, trusted them with our secrets and our lives. But they betrayed that trust, forming an army to destroy us. They enslaved us, killed our children... We will never forgive them for that." Ryder said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock, finally understanding the depth of hatred he had encountered when he first arrived.

 "I'm sorry,I didn't know about that." Kaiden said gently.

Ryder's expression softened, his eyes filled with a deep sadness. "Of course you didn't. It was your forefathers who committed those atrocities. But I sincerely wish we could put this behind us and live in harmony." Ryder said.

"So, are there any humans living here?" Kaiden asked.

Ryder shook his head. "None that I know of. They were wiped out long ago. Maybe some are living in secret, but I haven't seen one except for you." Ryder said.

Kaiden chuckled nervously. "Now I'm afraid of going to your town."

Ryder grinned, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "You don't have to worry, okay? I've got your back.”
.
.
.       NIGHTSHADE CITY

Thane and Cassius stepped out of the palanquin, stretching their limbs after the long journey. Alpha Cain and Luna Raye, their parents, were already waiting for them, their faces etched with concern.

Cassius, being the future Alpha, received the bulk of their attention. Alpha Cain and Luna Raye hugged him tightly, checking his body for any signs of injury. 

"I hope they're feeding you well?" Luna Raye asked, her voice laced with worry.

Cassius smiled reassuringly. "I'm okay, Mum. You don't have to worry."

Thane, on the other hand, received a cursory glance from his parents. He was used to being treated this way, like an afterthought. As the second son, he was considered a mistake, a surprise birth that no one had expected.

But Thane didn't let it get to him. He had learned to navigate the complexities of his family dynamics, to find his own place in the shadows. He followed behind his parents and Cassius, content to observe from a distance.

As they entered the palace, Thane was greeted by a familiar voice. 

"How was school, Thane?" Beta Steve asked, his eyes warm with genuine interest.

Thane smiled, Beta Steve was the only one who seemed to care about him, who treated him like a person rather than a mere afterthought.

"It was good, Beta," Thane replied, hugging the older man tightly.

 "I'm just happy to see you again." He added.

Beta Steve smiled,  "I'm happy to see you too, Thane. You're not looking too good, though. Is everything okay?"

Thane shrugged, trying to brush off his concerns. "Yeah, Beta, I'm just tired. It's been a long journey."

Beta Steve nodded sympathetically. "Well, get some rest then. We'll catch up later."

Thane nodded, watching as Beta Steve joined the conversation with his parents and Cassius. He find a corner to sit and just listen.

   “King Edward want you to visit him at the palace” Alpha Cain said.

"I'm not going,I've already rejected her." Cassius muttered.

Luna Raye gasped, her face pale. "Why, sweetheart? You can't disrespect the king like that."

Cassius stood up, his eyes flashing with defiance. "I don't care about the king. I care about who I want to spend my life with." He said.

Alpha Cain's face darkened. "Is it because of that girl? She's cursed, Cassius. You can't bring someone like her into our family, you are the future Alpha remember"Alpha Cain said.
 
Cassius's face twisted in anger. "I don't care what you both say. She's the one I want." He said stubbornly.

   “You have to rethink this, are  you going to humiliate her, you know how a girl feel when she was rejected by her mate”Luna Raye said.

    “I can't believe we are having this type of conversation when I am just arriving from a long journey, I need to rest” he said and storm off.

Luna Raye finally noticed Thane sitting in the corner, watching the scene unfold.

 "Are you not talking to your brother?" she asked coldly.

"I did, but you know your son."Thane shrugged and also left.
.

.
.

As the palanquin rode through the streets, Kaiden's eyes widened in amazement. The city was transformed into a winter wonderland, with intricate decorations and lights that seemed to dance in the air. The atmosphere was electric, with people laughing and chatting as they went about their evening.

Kaiden watched in awe, having never seen anything like it before. He felt like a kid in a candy store, his eyes darting from one wonder to the next.

The palanquin stopped in front of a massive gate, which swung open with a creak. The guards bowed low as Ryder stepped out, followed by Kaiden.

As they entered the place, Kaiden's eyes widened in awe. The interior was just as impressive as the exterior, with high ceilings and intricate tapestries.

Ryder's parents, were already waiting outside with some other people.

 "Crown Prince Ryder," the people said, bowing low.

Kaiden's eyes nearly popped out of his head. Crown Prince Ryder? He had no idea his friend was royalty!

Ryder hugged his parents, laughing and chatting with them like they were old friends. Kaiden, on the other hand, felt like a fish out of water.

  “Meet my friend, Kaiden, he will be staying with us for the festival” Ryder said and his parents look toward Kaiden, he was so nervous and didn't know what to do. He bowed awkwardly, feeling like a clumsy oaf.

The queen smiled warmly at Kaiden. "You're so handsome, feel at home. You don't have to worry about anything." She said.

Kaiden's face flushed with embarrassment, but he smiled back at her, feeling a little more at ease.

As they entered the palace, "Where is my sister?" Ryder asked while looking around.

"In her chamber."His father replied.

Ryder nodded and headed off in the direction of his sister's room. Kaiden followed close behind, still feeling a little dazed.
As they walked, Kaiden turned to Ryder.

"You didn't tell me you're a prince, a crown prince!" He whisper.

"I don't like telling people. I like my private life, okay?"Ryder chuckled.

Kaiden nodded, still feeling a little shocked.

They arrived at Belladonna's room, and Ryder opened the door. Bella was sitting on a couch, reading a book. She looked up and smiled when she saw her brother.

"Brother!" she exclaimed, jumping up to hug him.

Ryder laughed and hugged her back. 

"You're embarrassing me. We see each other every day in school." He said after sometime.

"But I can't even call you brother!"Bella scoffed and look toward Kaiden.

 “It's the human boy, it's nice to finally be talking to you” Belladonna said.

"Sister, don't let people hear you."Ryder whispered.

"They won't." Bella smile and wave at Kaiden who return it with a smile.

Bella turned to Kaiden and smiled. "Hi."

Kaiden smiled back. "Hi."

“You are like a star, human boy"Belladonna said.

 "Sister, don't. His name is Kaiden"Ryder whispered.

Bella just laughed and headed off to set the tabel, since she prepare dinner.

"I had no idea she was your sister. She's so different from how she is in school." Kaiden said with a smile.

Ryder smiled. "She just puts on a tough face because of her reputation as the princess. But she's not bad." He said.

Kaiden nodded, still feeling a little surprised.

"Come on, guys, food is ready!"Bella's voice called out from the other room.

"Let's go, she cook the most delicious meal ever."Ryder grinned. 
.
.
.

Benedicta stormed into the dining room, dropping her food on the table. She was furious, and she didn't know why. She just felt like she was going to explode.

She turned and walked out of the dining room, heading straight for her mother's room. But when she got there, Mistress Morwen wasn't there. She check the study room and she wasn't there too, so she finally had the idea where she could be. She approached a room and saw her mother sitting on the bed.

The room was beautiful, with a big bed and a desk. It looked like a room that had been specially designed for someone. 

"What are you doing?" Benedicta asked, her voice cold and hard.

Her mother turned around, a sad look on her face.

 "I just couldn't stop thinking about how beautiful it would be for her to sleep in this room," she said.

 "For her to attend the festival like every other person. I felt like I wasn't a good mother for not making that happen." Mistress Morwen added.

Benedicta's anger boiled over. "So you're going to start worrying about her again?" she asked, her voice rising. "Did you ever care about me?"

Her mother looked at her in surprise. "What are you talking about, Benedicta?" she asked.

 "I saw you every year, how sad you were when it was time for the festival," she said. "Have you ever thought about me too? I'm your daughter too." She yelled.

Her mother's expression changed, and she looked at Benedicta with a mixture of sadness and guilt. "You're being selfish, Benedicta," she said. "You have everything Maledicta will ever want. She's been living in darkness all her life, and you're still complaining." She said.

Benedicta's face twisted with anger and hurt. "Why is it always her?" she cried. "I want to be loved too."

Her mother's expression softened, and she walked towards Benedicta. "You know I love and care for you both," she said.

But Benedicta was beyond consolation. "No, you don't," she said, her voice cold and hard.

 "If you did, you wouldn't be thinking about her when I'm right next to you." She said and with that, she turned and stormed out of the room, leaving her mother behind.

Mistress Morwen called after her, but Benedicta didn't listen. She just kept walking, her heart heavy with anger and hurt.

As she walked away, Mistress Morwen sighed sadly.

 "What's wrong with her?" she muttered to herself.
.
.
.

Aka stepped into the motel room, her eyes scanning the space with a mixture of disdain and boredom. The two guards standing at the door nodded at her, their faces expressionless.

Aka's gaze lingered on them for a moment before she turned away, her mind preoccupied with more pressing matters. She had been searching for Kaiden, but he seemed to have vanished into thin air. It was infuriating, especially since she had plans for both him.

As she walked over to the window, she heard the sound of laughter and music drifting from outside. She pulled back the curtain, and her eyes narrowed as she took in the scene below.

A group of children were dancing in the street, their faces alight with joy. They carried baskets of flowers, which they tossed into the air, creating a colorful spectacle. The atmosphere was festive, and Aka's anger grew as she watched.

Her fists clenched, and her eyes flashed with fury. How dare they be so happy, so carefree, when she was suffering? When she didn't have a father because of them.

Aka's gaze dropped to the handkerchief in her hand, and her expression softened. It was a delicate, lace-trimmed square of fabric, with intricate embroidery that seemed to shimmer in the dim light.

She remembered her father giving it to her, his eyes filled with love and kindness. "I made this for you, Aka," he had said. "Always remember me when you look at it."

Aka's eyes had shone with tears as she hugged her father tightly. "Thank you, Dad," she had whispered. "It's so beautiful."

But now, as she stared at the handkerchief, Aka's feelings were far from beautiful. She felt a deep-seated anger, a sense of betrayal and hurt.

"You're all happy after giving me pain," she spat, her voice venomous. She folded the handkerchief, her hands shaking with rage.

 Aka closed her eyes and began to chant. The words were low and husky, and they seemed to vibrate with a dark, malevolent energy.

As she spoke, the air around her seemed to grow colder, the shadows deepening and twisting into grotesque forms. And then, in a flash of sulfurous smoke, a demon appeared before her.

It was a hideous creature, with twisted horns and scales that seemed to ripple like living flame. Aka's eyes snapped open, and she gazed at the demon with a cold, calculating gaze.

"Make this night a nightmare for them all," she whispered, her voice dripping with malice.

The demon bowed, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy. And then, in an instant, it vanished, leaving Aka alone in the darkness.

Aka lay down on the bed, the handkerchief clutched tightly to her chest. She felt a sense of satisfaction. Tonight, she would unleash her wrath upon the city, and no one would be spared.

Ryder was in the middle of explaining the history of the festival when he noticed Kaiden's attention start to wander. He stopped mid-sentence, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied Kaiden's expression.

"What's wrong?" Ryder asked, his voice tinged with concern.

Kaiden forced a smile onto his face. "It's nothing."

Ryder's eyes searched Kaiden's face, as if trying to read his thoughts. "Is it because I kept secrets from you? I'm so sorry, Kaiden." He said.

Kaiden shook his head, feeling a pang of guilt. "That's not it, Ryder. Maybe I'm just tired."

Ryder nodded understandingly. "Sleep then. Should I stay with you?" He asked.

Kaiden smiled again,  "Don't worry, I'll be okay alone." He said.

Ryder nodded and stood up, "Get some rest then. I'll see you tomorrow." He said and left.

As soon as Ryder left, Kaiden felt his mind start to wander again. He couldn't stop thinking about Maledicta, wondering what she was doing alone in the school. Was she sad? Had she eaten?

He tossed and turned on the bed, unable to shake off the feeling of unease.

Just as he was starting to drift off to sleep, he heard a knock at the door. He sat up,He got out of bed and padded to the door, opening it to reveal Maledicta standing in the do moo r. She looked a little disheveled, her hair messy and her eyes wild.She launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his waist and holding him tightly.

Kaiden was taken aback by the ferocity of her hug, but he quickly recovered, wrapping his arms around her and holding her close.

"How did you get here?" he asked, his voice muffled by her hair.

Maledicta muttered something incoherent, her voice barely audible.

Kaiden pulled back, studying her face. She looked a little wild-eyed, her pupils dilated.

"Maledicta, what's wrong?" he asked, his voice soft with concern.

Maledicta's eyes focused on his, "I couldn't stop thinking about you, Kaiden. I miss you so much." She said.

“How did you know I am here?” He asked.

“The voices told Me” she said.

Kaiden smile and he pulled her close again. "I miss you too, Maledicta. So much." He said.

He pulled back, studying her face. 

"So, are you going to the festival with me?" he asked.

Maledicta nodded, "Yes, I am." She said.

Kaiden grinned, feeling elated. He hugged her tightly again and both couldn't stop smiling.

            (CURSED WITCH)

"Are you going to stay here with me?" Kaiden asked after some minutes of silence.

Maledicta shook her head. "No, I need to see my mum first. I'll find you tomorrow, okay?"

Kaiden smiled while staring at her, his eyes filled with affection. He almost thought of kissing her, but changed his mind when he remembered how she stopped him the other night.

"I should go," Maledicta said, releasing herself from his grip.

Kaiden watched as she vanished into thin air, a large smile still plastered on his face. He lay on his bed.His mind was finally at peace, and he soon fell asleep, dreaming of Maledicta and the festival they would attend together.

Meanwhile, Mistress Morwen was about to enter her room when Maledicta suddenly appeared in front of her. She was shocked to see her daughter standing there.

"What's going on? Did something happen in school?" Mistress Morwen asked worriedly.

Maledicta shook her head. "No, mum, I'm here for the festival."

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened in shock. "Did you mean it?" she asked, her voice trembling with excitement.

“Have I ever joke?"Maledicta scoffed. 

Mistress Morwen suddenly pulled Maledicta into a deep hug, her heart beaming with joy.

 "You don't know how much I'm thrilled to hear that from you. Don't worry, no one will ever find out." She said.

Maledicta rolled her eyes, feeling a little uncomfortable with the sudden display of affection. 

"Stop being dramatic," she said, releasing herself from her mother's grip.

Mistress Morwen smiled, her eyes shining with happiness. "Follow me, I have somewhere to show you."

Maledicta followed her mother, looking around at the beautiful house. She couldn't believe this was her family's house, and she had never been there before.

They entered a beautiful room, filled with intricate furnishings and delicate decorations. Maledicta's eyes widened in surprise as she took in the sight.

"I've made this room for you since you were born," Mistress Morwen said, her voice filled with emotion.

 "I didn't know a day like this would come when you would finally be able to sleep in it." She added with a smile.

Maledicta scoffed, feeling a little embarrassed by her mother's display of emotion.

 "Are you that happy about it?" She asked.

Mistress Morwen nodded, her eyes shining with tears. "You can't understand. I've really been waiting all my life. I could give you a golden pill to help you blend in, because you have to disguise yourself." She said.

Maledicta shook her head. "Don't worry, mum, I can take care of myself."

Mistress Morwen hugged her again, holding her tightly. 

"Thank you very much for coming and making this year the happiest in my life."  She said.

Maledicta hugged her mother back, feeling a little weird. This was the first time she had ever hugged her mother, and it kind of felt nice.

As they hugged, Benedicta entered the mansion, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of life. She spotted the light on in Mistress Morwen's room and headed towards it, curious about what was going on.

But as she approached the room, she was surprised to see Maledicta and Mistress Morwen hugging. The surprise quickly turned to anger, and Benedicta stormed off to her own room, slamming the door behind her.

She scattered everything in her room, her anger and frustration boiling over. She lay on the bed while breathing heavily in anger.

                     THE DAY

Mistress Morwen's eyes sparkled with delight as she gazed at Maledicta.

 "You look so pretty, dear," she said, her voice warm with affection.

Maledicta's expression turned icy, and she quickly covered her face with a facemask. Her hair was also hidden beneath a hood, but despite her efforts to conceal herself, she still looked breathtakingly beautiful.

"Stop saying that, I don't want to hear it," Maledicta muttered.

Benedicta's smile was wide and fake as she hugged Maledicta tightly.

 "Sister, I'm sure you're going to have a lot of fun today," she said.

Maledicta quickly released herself from Benedicta's grasp and moved away, her eyes flashing with annoyance.

"Where are we going first?" Maledicta turned to her mother, her voice neutral.

 "To the palace, to recieve the first blessing. Then we'll move to the streets. Have fun, because I won't be around." She said.

Benedicta's face fell, and she pouted cutely. "But why, Mum?"

 "Something mysterious attacked some children last night. We have to find out what it is. You two should have fun." Mistress Morwen said.

With that, Mistress Morwen turned and left, leaving Benedicta and Maledicta to make their way to the palace.

The palace was a riot of color and sound, with people laughing and chatting as they made their way to the grand hall. Kaiden's eyes widened in awe as he took in the sights and sounds.

"I like this place, it's beautiful," he said, his voice full of wonder.

"We're just getting started. I'm sure you're going to love it."Ryder grinned while looking around maybe he will see Aka.

As they entered the grand hall, Kaiden's eyes nearly popped out of his head. The hall was filled with people, all dressed in their finest clothes. The king and queen sat at the top of the hall, surrounded by the Alpha, Beta, and Luna, as well as the ministers.

Princess Belladonna sat in the middle of Alpha Prince Thane and Cassius, her bright smile lighting up the hall. Cassius, on the other hand, looked like he'd rather be anywhere else, his eyes fixed on some point across the hall, Thane smile at Belladonna and she return it immediately.

“You are supposed to be there with Them” Kaiden said.

“I told you I hate attention, I am not ready for all this now” he grinned.

Benedicta entered the hall, her eyes scanning the crowd as she searched for Kaiden. She was relieved to have lost Maledicta in the crowd, not wanting to be seen with her weird sister.

As she spotted Ryder and Kaiden, she adjusted her hair and made her way over to them, a bright smile plastered on her face.

A huge sculpture of their goddess was pushed into the hall, and the crowd erupted into cheers. The sculpture was breathtakingly beautiful, with golden long hair and eyes that seemed to shine like diamonds.

A flower crown adorned her head, and a delicate garland encircled her waist. The crowd bowed low, receiving blessings from their priest.

Aka slipped into the hall, her eyes fixed on the sculpture with a burning intensity. She looked like she wanted to destroy it, her face twisted with anger.

As the blessing ended, the crowd threw flowers into the air, and the hall erupted into music and laughter. People began to dance, twirling and spinning to the rhythm.

Kaiden watched in amazement, feeling like he'd stumbled into a dream world. Ryder grinned at him, pulling him into the dance.

As they twirled and spun, Kaiden felt a sense of freedom he'd never experienced before. He was caught up in the magic of the moment, surrounded by people who seemed to accept him for who he was.

But as he glanced around the hall, he caught sight of Maledicta standing alone, her facemask glinting in the light. She looked like a ghost, a haunting presence that seemed to hover on the edges of the celebration.

Kaiden's heart went out to her, and he felt a pang of guilt for not seeking her out earlier. He made a mental note to find her later, to make sure she was okay.
.
.
.
.

The group walked through the crowded streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the celebration. Kaiden's eyes scanned the crowd, his brow furrowed in concentration.

"Are you looking for someone?" Benedicta asked, her voice low and husky. She had been following him around, her eyes fixed on him with an unnerving intensity.

Kaiden quickly shook his head. "No, I'm just enjoying the view."

Benedicta's smile never wavered, but her eyes seemed to narrow slightly. "I see," she said.

Just then, someone touched Kaiden's arm, and he turned to see a girl wearing a mask. He didn't need to be told who it was - he knew instinctively.

"You're here," he said, his face breaking out into a wide smile.

Ryder, who had been walking beside Kaiden, looked at the masked girl with curiosity. 

"Who is this?" he asked.

"She's a friend from school."Kaiden smiled.

Ryder nodded, his eyes friendly. "Nice to meet you."

The masked girl didn't respond, and Kaiden quickly intervened.

 "She doesn't like talking," he explained.

Ryder's smile faltered for a moment, but he quickly recovered. "Oh, okay."

Just then, Belladonna appeared, her eyes sparkling with excitement. 

"Hey, everyone!" she exclaimed.

Her gaze landed on Maledicta, and her eyes widened in surprise.

 "Who is this?" she asked.

"A friend."Benedicta smiled sweetly.

Belladonna raised an eyebrow, but she didn't press the issue. Instead, she turned to the mask girl and grabbed her hand. 

“Keep me company, let me show you around." She said.

Maledicta couldn't resist, and Belladonna dragged her away, leaving the others to follow behind.

As they walked, Belladonna chattered excitedly about the different stalls and vendors they passed. Maledicta listened silently, her eyes taking in everything around her.

Eventually, they stopped at a stall selling all sorts of girly accessories. Belladonna's eyes widened as she scanned the shelves, and she quickly picked up a few items.

Maledicta watched as Belladonna expertly applied a coat of nail polish to her fingers. When she finished, she stepped back to admire her handiwork.

"How is it?" she asked.

Maledicta stared at her fingers, and for a moment, she forgot to be guarded. She looked sincerely happy, and Belladonna grinned in response.

  “I wish I can see your face, I am sure I will have a lot of adjustments to make on it” Belladonna said, Maledicta didn't respond.

  “I can see you don't like talking” Belladonna smile and took her to another place.

As they continued to explore the festival, Kaiden watched them with a warm heart. He was happy to see Maledicta having fun.

Benedicta, on the other hand, looked less than pleased. Her eyes narrowed as she watched Kaiden, her face twisted in a scowl.

Aka, who was watching from a distance, felt a pang of frustration. She couldn't approach Kaiden, not with Benedicta hovering around him like a possessive shadow.

                    NIGHTIME

The lake was a vision of serenity, its crystal-clear waters reflecting the vibrant colors of the surrounding landscape. Canoes dotted the lake's surface, their occupants laughing and chatting as they drifted lazily across the water.

Kaiden sat in one of the canoes, his eyes wide with wonder as he took in the breathtaking scenery. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of gentle lapping of the water against the shore created a soothing melody.

As he gazed out at the lake, Kaiden spotted a school of fish swimming in the depths of the water. The fish were surrounded by a halo of light, their scales shimmering like diamonds in the sunlight.

Kaiden's eyes followed the fish as they darted through the water, their movements creating a mesmerizing display of aquatic acrobatics. He felt as though he was witnessing a magical world, one that existed beneath the surface of the lake.

"I wish I had my phone with me," Kaiden said, his voice filled with longing. "I wouldn't have missed recording everything."

Benedicta, who was sitting in the canoe beside him, turned to "What's a phone?" she asked.

"It's something totally amazing, created in our world, You can use it to capture images and videos, and even communicate with people over long distances." He said.

"I wish I could see it," Ryder said. He was also sitting beside Kaiden.

As they continued to drift across the lake, the sky began to darken, and the air grew cooler. Suddenly, a bright golden moon appeared in the sky, casting a warm glow over the landscape.

"It's time to make your wish," Belladonna yelled, her voice carrying across the water.

Kaiden watched as everyone closed their eyes, their faces tilted upwards towards the moon. He stood up, his eyes scanning the crowd until he spotted Maledicta standing on the shore.

He made his way towards her, As he reached her side, he turned to face her, their eyes locking for a moment.

Together, they closed their eyes, their minds focused on the wishes they wanted to make. 

As they stood there, the only sound being the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, Kaiden felt a sense of connection to Maledicta that he had never felt before. It was as though they were two souls, bound together by a shared destiny.

Benedicta, who was watching from the canoe, felt a pang of jealousy. She had never seen Kaiden look at anyone with such intensity, such passion. She felt as though she was losing him, as though he was slipping away from her grasp.

As the moon reached its zenith in the sky, Belladonna and Maledicta dropped water into the lake, creating a ripple effect that spread across the surface of the water.

Kaiden returned to his seat, his eyes fixed on Maledicta as she stood on the shore with Belladonna.

 "Who is that masked girl?" Ryder asked again, his eyes fixed on Maledicta who was still playing with water.

Kaiden turned to him, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "I told you, she's a friend."

Ryder's eyes narrowed,  "That's not the answer I want,She looks familiar, and my sister has grown really attached to her." Ryder said.

Kaiden leaned in close,  "She's Maledicta." He whispered.

Ryder's eyes widened in shock, and for a moment, he seemed frozen in place. Then, a slow smile spread across his face, and he started to chuckle.

"This should be interesting," he said.

"I can't wait to see my sister's reaction when she realizes she's been having fun with her greatest enemy." He laughed.

As Ryder spoke, the sky suddenly darkened, and a loud rumbling noise echoed across the lake. The water began to churn and foam, and people started to fall into the lake, their screams echoing across the water.

Kaiden's eyes widened in horror as he watched the chaos unfold. What was happening? And why was everything falling apart?

A dark demon emerged from the water, Aka's face lit up with a malevolent smile. She had been waiting for this moment, and she was eager to see the chaos unfold.

The people around her shouted in fear, scrambling to get out of the canoes and away from the demon. The group of students immediately sprang into action, working together to save those who had fallen into the water.

Maledicta flew into the water, her movements swift and agile as she plucked children from the lake's surface. Ryder, Cassius, Thane, and some of the other male students charged forward, ready to face the demon.

As they fought, the demon suddenly multiplied, its body splitting into multiple copies of itself. The people gasped in shock, unsure of what to do.

"It's Baa, A splitting demon!" Cassius yelled, his sword flashing in the moonlight.

 "We have to find the real one and kill it!” He added.

The group of students fought bravely, their movements swift and coordinated. Thane finally managed to cut down the original demon, and the copies vanished instantly.

"Baa is still coming back, let's get the people to safety!" Belladonna yelled, her voice carrying across the water.

As the students helped the people to safety, Maledicta spotted a little girl crying on the ground. She approached the girl slowly, her hand outstretched.

Just as the girl was about to take Maledicta's hand, an arrow swooped past, cutting the rope of her mask and sending it tumbling to the ground. Maledicta's hood fell off, and her waist-length white hair cascaded down her back.

The people around her gasped in shock, their faces filled with a mix of fear and revulsion.

"It's the cursed girl!" one man yelled, his voice echoing across the water.

The people stopped to stare at Maledicta, their eyes filled with accusation. Belladonna's mouth hung open in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief, she couldn't believe she has been hanging out with Maledicta all this while.

Benedicta, on the other hand, laughed with satisfaction, her eyes gleaming with malice.

"What are you doing in our town?" one of the men yelled, his face twisted with anger.

 "You bring this disaster upon us, you cursed witch look what you have done!" A woman yelled, her blazing in anger.

The people began to close in on Maledicta, their faces filled with hostility. They surrounded her, their eyes blazing with anger.

"Take your bad luck and leave our town!" a woman yelled, her voice shrill with fear.

Maledicta stood frozen, her eyes wide with shock. She felt like she was going to be torn apart by the angry mob, the look on their face was filled with hatred, that he regretted coming to the town immediately.

Just as the situation was about to escalate, Kaiden appeared out of nowhere, his body shielding Maledicta from the angry crowd.

One of the men picked up a stone and threw it at Maledicta, but Kaiden intercepted it, the stone hitting him instead. The crowd began to pick up more stones, their faces twisted with anger.

"Boy, leave her right now, or you'll die with the cursed witch!" one of the men yelled, his voice dripping with malice.

Kaiden stood his ground,  "No one is going to touch her, over my dead body," he yelled, his voice booming throughout the place.

                (DO IT)

The man's impatient voice cut through the air, his eyes fixed menacingly on Kaiden. 

"Boy, we can't wait all day. If you don't move away, you'll be stoned with her." He said.
Kaiden stood firm,  "I'm not moving an inch from here." He said.

"Kaiden!"Benedicta's voice rang out, laced with worry.

The man's face twisted in anger, and he raised his hand, ready to throw the stone. But before he could, Belladonna darted forward, joining Kaiden in shielding Maledicta.

The crowd gasped in shock, their eyes fixed on the her.

 "It's the princess!" one of the women whispered.

"Princess, please move away."A woman begged.

But Belladonna stood firm, her eyes flashing with defiance. "No one is hurting her."

Cassius joined them, his broad shoulders adding to the protective shield around Maledicta. 

"The Alpha prince!" someone gasped.

Thane and Lilith followed suit, their faces set in a frown. Arachne's bright smile faltered for a moment before she joined the group, her eyes fixed on Maledicta with an unnerving intensity.

Ryder completed the circle, his eyes locked on Benedicta's unreadable expression. The group formed a united front, their eyes daring anyone to challenge them.

Benedicta's face twisted in anger, her eyes blazing with fury. She felt like killing them all, especially Belladonna. But then, her expression changed, and she burst into fake tears.

"Thank you all, thank you for standing up for my sister," she sobbed, joining the group.

The crowd murmured, their faces filled with confusion and uncertainty. 

"What are you all doing? The king won't be happy if he hears about this!"A man yelled.

"You all misunderstood her. She's not the one who brought demons here. She's one of us, trying to save you all."Belladonna's voice rang out, clear and strong.

 "Did you expect us to believe you? This girl has brought nothing but misfortune to us!"A woman shouted back.

"She didn't! She saved a lot of people. Why aren't you talking, those of you she saved?"Kaiden's voice rose in anger.

"She saved me from drowning."A girl spoke up, her voice trembling.

"She saved me from the demon."A boy added.

"She was trying to help me up, and she also saved my younger sister."The girl on the ground spoke up, her eyes shining with gratitude.

"See? She's no threat. She was just trying to save her people. Baa will be here soon, watch as she tries to protect you."Cassius's voice cut through the noise.

The moment Cassius stopped talking, the air grew quiet, and then it went suddenly dark. The crowd gasped, their hearts racing with fear.

"Everyone, find someplace to hide!"Lilith's voice shouted out.

The group quickly scattered, searching for shelter from the impending attack. Kaiden grabbed Maledicta's hand, pulling her towards a nearby building.

As they ran, the sound of screams and crashing echoed through the air. Baa had arrived, and chaos had descended upon the town once again.

  The students suddenly stop and turn to face the demons.

  “Don't be afraid, we can do it, let get ride of this lousy demon” Belladonna scream.

The students charged forward, their swords flashing in the moonlight as they clashed with the demon. Baa, the splitting demon, lived up to its name, splitting into over a hundred images of itself.

The students were surrounded, but they refused to back down. Ryder, Cassius, and Thane fought valiantly, their movements swift as they cut the demon with their sword. Belladonna and the other female students fought with equal ferocity, their will evident on their faces.

But Maledicta moved with an unnatural speed, her sword slicing through the demon's images with ease. Her power was mesmerizing, and the students couldn't help but watch in awe as she fought.

As the battle raged on, Maledicta began to glow with an ethereal light. Her sword shone brighter, and her movements became even faster. She was a force to be reckoned with, and the demon's images began to fall before her.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Maledicta spotted the real Baa. She charged forward, her sword flashing in the moonlight. With a swift and deadly strike, she cut off the demon's head, and its images vanished instantly.

The students cheered, their voices echoing across the lake. The people, who had been hiding in fear, began to emerge from their hiding places. They gathered around Maledicta and the other students, their faces filled with gratitude.

"Thank you all for saving us," a man said, his voice trembling with emotion.

"If it hadn't been for you all, we would have been dead,Our power is no match for the demon." A woman added.

"We're sorry for the way we treated you at first," a man said.

 "We shouldn't have done that."  Another one said as they bow in front of her.

Maledicta muttered a brief response, her face still cold. But the people didn't seem to mind. They were just grateful to be alive.

As the people began to disperse, a girl waved at Maledicta, and she returned the wave, her face softening ever so slightly.

Cassius approached Maledicta, his eyes scanning her body for any signs of injury. 

"Are you okay?" he asked.

Maledicta muttered a brief response, pushing him away. But Cassius didn't seem to mind. He was just relieved that she was safe.

Belladonna, on the other hand, looked a bit worse for wear. She had sustained some bruises during the fight, but Cassius didn't seem to notice. Thane, however, did. He approached Belladonna, his eyes filled with concern.

"Are you okay?" he asked gently.

Belladonna nodded, smiling weakly. Thane handed her a bottle of ointment.

“Remember to use it” he said and nodded.

As the students began to leave, Maledicta approached Kaiden. But she stopped when she saw Benedicta already by his side. She turned and walked away, her face cold and unyielding.

The students left, and the people began to return to their daily lives. But Mistress Morwen and her group arrived, their faces some minutes later.

"We heard a demon was here," Mistress Morwen said, her eyes scanning the area.

The man they had approached nodded. "Yes, that's true. But the white-haired girl and her friends helped us." He said.

Mistress Morwen's eyes narrowed.

 "White hair? Did you mean the cursed girl?" One of her group members asked.

"Yes, she helped us."The man nodded.

The group began to whisper among themselves, their faces filled with surprise. Mistress Morwen, however, couldn't stop smiling. She was glad to hear that Maledicta had helped the people.
.
.
.

The fun had already come to an end, and people were starting to head home, exhausted but happy after a day of celebration. Benedicta, however, was still looking around for Kaiden, her eyes scanning the crowd.

Just as she was starting to get frustrated, someone suddenly dragged her away from the crowd. She turned to see Belladonna glaring at her.

"What do you want?" Benedicta asked angrily, trying to wriggle free from Belladonna's grasp.

"I know you're the one who shot the arrow," Belladonna said, her voice low and even. 

"You did it intentionally to expose Maledicta." She added.

Benedicta's eyes widened in feigned innocence. "What are you talking about? Why would I want to hurt my sister?"

Belladonna's expression didn't change. "That's what I'm wondering. She's your sister, but I saw you myself shooting the arrow. You were so happy, grinning from ear to ear when she was discovered. And then, the next minute, you were faking tears, showing everyone how caring and concerned you were. That's when I realized you're a two-faced witch." Belladonna said.

Benedicta's face twisted in anger. "You shouldn't involve yourself in this matter. It's between Maledicta and me." She snapped.

Belladonna shook her head. "Sorry, but I'm going to involve myself. If you continue down this path, I'll make sure everyone knows the real you." She said and  turned to leave. 

"Why are you suddenly defending her? I thought you hated her too." Benedicta asked.

Belladonna stopped and turned back to Benedicta.

 "Of course, I hated her. But today, I realized how terrible I was. She's been facing so much, suffering for something she knows nothing about. And I, a princess with the best life, was hating on her. I was ashamed of myself, and I won't stop being ashamed until I make amends." She said.

Benedicta's face twisted in disgust. "You're just feeling guilty because you're a weak princess." She said.

Belladonna's expression didn't change. 

“Maybe i am guilty, but not because I  am weak but because this is the right thing to do” Belladonna said.

“ What about Cassius? He didn't even look at you because of Maledicta. Are you going to stay and just watch that?" Be media” Benedicta asked.

Belladonna's eyes seemed to cloud over for a moment, but then she shook her head.

 "I won't fight anyone because of Cassius. I can't force him to like me. I'll just keep waiting for him, and if he doesn't notice me before I get tired of waiting, then I'll move on." She said and with that, Belladonna turned and left, leaving Benedicta seething with anger. Benedicta watched her go, her heart heaving with rage and frustration.

               A DAY LATER

The sun had barely risen over the horizon, but the students of the academy were already bustling about, eager to start their day. The atmosphere was lively, with laughter and chatter filling the air.

Belladonna made her way to Maledicta's room, She had decided that it was time to drag Maledicta out of her shell, and she was not going to take no for an answer.

As she approached the door, she was nearly cut by the shield that Maledicta had built around it. But Belladonna was not one to be deterred. She focused all her energy and managed to break through the shield, bursting into the room with a triumphant smile.

Maledicta was lying on her bed, her eyes open and staring at the ceiling. She didn't seem to be sleeping, but she didn't acknowledge Belladonna's presence either.

"I can't believe you're still here when everyone else is already in the dining hall waiting for breakfast," Belladonna said, striding over to the bed.

Maledicta slowly turned her head, her eyes narrowing as she looked at Belladonna.

 "What are you doing here?" she asked coldly.

"To drag you to the hall, of course. It's time for breakfast."Belladonna grinned.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, but she sat up, her movements fluid and graceful. 

"I'm not going," she said, her voice firm.

"I don't take no for an answer. You'll dress up now, and we'll go together."Belladonna chuckled.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger, but Belladonna just laughed.

 "Who are you to tell me what to do?" Maledicta scoffed.

Belladonna's smile never wavered. "I'm your friend, your one and only friend." She said.

"When did I accept to be your friend?"Maledicta raised an eyebrow.

"You don't have to accept. I choose you, and I'm not afraid of you."Belladonna shrugged.

Maledicta's expression turned icy, but Belladonna just dragged her out of bed and into the bathroom.

   “I talk to father and she said you can come to the town anytime you want” Belladonna said, Maledicta didn't say anything.

   “Not even a thank you?” Belladonna asked.

    “I didn't asked you to” Maledicta muttered and Belladonna gasp but then smile instead.

 "You can't drove me away no mater what,Time for a shower," she said, turning on the water.

Maledicta struggled, but Belladonna was too strong. She was dragged under the shower, the warm water cascading down her body.

As they showered, Belladonna couldn't help but notice how plain Maledicta looked. Her hair was dull, her face pale, and her clothes.

"Don't even come near me, or I'll..." Maledicta was saying, but Belladonna just laughed.

She dragged Maledicta to a chair and started styling her hair, weaving flowers into the strands. She applied a glow to Maledicta's face, highlighting her cheekbones and lips.

As they finished up, Belladonna stepped back to admire her handiwork. Maledicta looked breathtaking, her beauty radiant and captivating.

"Now you look like a princess," Belladonna said, smiling.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, but she followed Belladonna out of the room, her eyes scanning the hallway.

As they entered the dining hall, the students couldn't help but stare. Maledicta's transformation was stunning, and she looked like a completely different person.

Arachne waved at her, but Maledicta didn't respond, her eyes fixed on Kaiden, who was staring at her with a look of wonder.

Belladonna dragged her to the senior table.

 "You're welcome among us," Lilith said, smiling.

Maledicta didn't respond, her eyes fixed on Kaiden, who couldn't stop looking at her. Cassius added more food to her plate, but she returned it immediately, starting to eat in silence.

Benedicta watched the scene unfold, her anger boiling over. It seemed like Maledicta was here to take her place, and she would never accept that.
.
.

Lilith walked with a smile on her face, her eyes fixed on the group of friends she had created. She had a special gift – the ability to make her imagination visible to others. With just a thought, she could bring her imaginary friends to life.

As she walked, lost in her own little world, she failed to notice the person standing in front of her. She bumped into him, and her feet flew out from under her. She was about to hit the ground, but the person caught her hand and dragged her up.

Lilith's eyes flew open as she found herself pressed against the person's chest. She quickly released herself, her face flushing with embarrassment, as she realized who the person was.

"Are you daydreaming again?" Thane asked, a smirk playing on his lips.

Lilith's embarrassment turned to irritation. "It's none of your business," she scoffed, trying to brush past him.

But Thane was not having it. He dragged her back, his eyes glinting with amusement.

 "I saved you, and all you can do is thank me," he said.

Lilith's eyes flashed with anger. "I didn't ask you to," she snapped.

"I just feel pity for you. You keep creating different men in your head, while you don't even try dating one of the real men we have around.”Thane chuckled. 

"You can give me that kind of advice when you find your own mate," she snapped angrily.

Thane's smirk grew wider. "It's not time yet, but she's coming, and she'll be the perfect mate ever." He said.

"When is that? Your brother found his already? Or maybe you don't have a mate. You can continue to crush on your brother's mate."Lilith raised an eyebrow.

Thane's eyes widened in shock, and for a moment, he seemed speechless. Then, his face darkened.

"I don't have any idea what you're saying. Just wait and see, I will soon find my mate, and we'll get married, while you'll continue to be a girl who creates men out of her imagination. Nothing more, nothing less." He snapped and with that, he turned and walked away, leaving Lilith seething with anger.

"I just hate his guts so much," Lilith muttered, her fists clenched as she glared at Thane's back.

The seniors, who had been watching the exchange, shook their heads. They knew that Lilith and Thane had a long history of clashing, and it seemed that their animosity towards each other was only growing stronger.

Kaiden was about to knock on Maledicta's door when it suddenly swung open, and she pushed him inside.

 "I've been expecting you all day," she muttered, her eyes fixed on his as she walked over to her bed and sat down.

Kaiden's eyes narrowed slightly as he closed the door behind him. "Really? Because I'm not sure that's true. You've totally forgotten about me since you've got friends now. We haven't even spoken for a day." He said.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, but her voice was laced with a hint of defensiveness. "You're having fun with Benedicta too. I didn't want to spoil your fun." She said.

Kaiden's frown deepened. "Who told you I was having fun? I couldn't stop thinking about you all day." He said.

"Really?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden nodded, his eyes locked on hers. "Yes, and this morning, you looked so beautiful. I felt like..." He stopped talking, his eyes fixed on hers as if mesmerized.

Maledicta's eyes seemed to bore into his soul, as if daring him to continue.

 "Feel like what? Say it," she muttered.

Kaiden's heart was racing, but he couldn't seem to tear his eyes away from hers. 

"I feel like kissing your lips," he said huskily.

For a moment, it seemed like time had stopped, and all that existed was the two of them.

Then, in a voice that was barely audible, Maledicta said, "Then do it."

Kaiden didn't waste any time. He slammed his lips down on hers, his kiss deep and passionate. Maledicta's lips parted, and she kissed him back, her arms wrapping around his neck as she pulled him closer.

The world around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, lost in the depths of their passion.

           (DESPERATE 1)

As they kissed, the intensity of their passion grew, and they both fell onto the bed, their bodies entwined. Kaiden was lost in the moment, his senses overwhelmed by the sensation of Maledicta's lips on his.

He could tell that this was her first time, and a sense of satisfaction washed over him. He felt a sense of pride, knowing that he was the one who got to experience this moment with her.

As they lay there, their kiss slowly came to an end, and they both rolled off each other, lying side by side on the bed. They were both silent for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.

Just as he was starting to drift off into his own thoughts, a loud thunder strike shook the air, making Maledicta jump. Kaiden looked over at her and saw the fear in her eyes.

He knew that she was afraid of thunderstorms, He reached out and took her hand, trying to offer her some comfort.

As the storm raged on outside, the rain started to pour down, drumming against the roof and walls of the room. The thunder boomed and crackled, making it hard to hear anything else.

Maledicta moved closer to Kaiden, her eyes closed tightly as she tried to block out the storm. Kaiden wrapped his arms around her, holding her close as he tried to calm her down.

"Don't worry, just relax," he whispered into her ear. "Nothing is going to happen."

He stroked her back, trying to soothe her as the storm raged on outside. Slowly but surely, Maledicta started to relax, her body easing into Kaiden's as she let out a deep breath.

As the minutes ticked by, the storm showed no signs of letting up, but Maledicta's grip on Kaiden's arm slowly loosened. Her eyes remained closed, but her breathing slowed, and she eventually fell asleep, her body curled up against Kaiden's.

Kaiden watched her, amazed that she had been able to fall asleep despite the storm raging on outside. He knew that this was a big deal for her, and he felt a sense of pride and satisfaction knowing that he had been able to help her feel safe.

As he lay there, holding Maledicta close, Kaiden realized that he would do anything to protect her. He would face any storm, any danger, as long as it meant keeping her safe.

The storm raged on outside, but inside, Kaiden and Maledicta were safe, wrapped in each other's arms, and lost in their own little world.

.
.
.
The stormy night was fierce, with heavy rains and strong winds that threatened to uproot the trees. But amidst the turmoil, a figure emerged, walking steadily through the downpour. As she approached Kaiden's door, she pushed back her hood, revealing Benedicta's face.

"Kaiden!" she called out, banging on the door with her fist. But there was no response.

"Kaiden, it's Benedicta! Please open the door, I can't sleep alone in my room!" she shouted, her voice carrying above the sound of the rain. But still, there was no answer.

Benedicta's face twisted in frustration. She used her power to open the door and stepped inside, calling out Kaiden's name again. But he was nowhere to be found. She checked his bathroom, but he wasn't there either.

A feeling of unease began to creep over her. Where could Kaiden be? She thought he would be in his room, especially on a night like this. But it seemed she was wrong.

Benedicta stepped back out into the storm, the rain pounding against her face. She made her way to Ryder's room, her heart burning with anger and suspicion. She knocked on the door, and after a few moments, Ryder opened it, looking surprised.

"Senior Benedicta, why are you out in the rain?" Ryder asked, his eyes scanning her drenched form.

Benedicta forced a bright smile onto her face.

 "Where is Kaiden?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

Ryder's expression turned curious. "Is he not in his room?" He asked.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment before she regained control. 

"I should have checked his room first. I just assumed he would be here, since it's raining." She said.

"He's not here."Ryder shook his head. 

Benedicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities of where he could be and she hope it's where she thinks he is.

"Forget I came here. You don't have to tell anyone," she said, turning to leave.

Ryder nodded, his eyes watching her as she disappeared into the night. He shivered, feeling the chill of the storm, and quickly returned to his bed, seeking the warmth and comfort of his blankets.

Benedicta, on the other hand, was not seeking comfort. She was driven by a burning anger to find out where Kaiden was. She made her way to Maledicta's room, the storm raging around her like a living thing.

As she stood in front of Maledicta's door, the rain pounding against her, she felt her anger boil over. She glared at the door, her eyes blazing with fury. She didn't bother to knock or try to enter. 

The storm raged on, but Benedicta didn't move. She was frozen in place, her anger and suspicion holding her captive. And as the minutes ticked by, her fury only grew, fueled by the stormy night and her own dark thoughts.
.

Kaiden turned over on the bed and opened his eyes to see Maledicta looking at him. He quickly sat up, and she laughed, the sound sending a shiver down his spine.

"Wow, your laugh is so beautiful," Kaiden said, his eyes fixed on hers.

 "I just wish you could continue to smile." He added.

Maledicta's smile disappeared, and she looked away, her expression turning serious. 

"Last night, I slept well,I just couldn't help but wonder why." She said.

Kaiden's brow furrowed in concern. "What do you mean?"

"There are some things I'm confused about. You just look so strange and different. I was expecting to be struck by thunder last night but nothing happened” she said.

"Is it bad that I look different?" he asked, trying to sound casual.

Maledicta shook her head. "I'm just so frustrated that I can't figure it out." She said.

Kaiden's eyes locked on hers, and he smiled. "You don't have to trouble yourself about it. Did you know my wish during the night of the festival?" He asked.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed slightly. “What was it?"

Kaiden's smile grew wider. "I wished for you to be happy, Maledicta." He said.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, but her eyes seemed to bore into his soul. 

"Why would you use your wish for me?" She asked.

 "Because you're special to me, and I think seeing you happy makes me feel satisfied." Kaiden said with a smile.

"You may regret getting closer to me." Maledicta said after some minutes.

Kaiden's smile never wavered. "I don't care."

He leaned forward and pecked her on the lips. Maledicta turned it into a deep kiss, and Kaiden's heart soared.

As they pulled away from each other, "I should leave. I have a training session with Senior Thane."Kaiden grinned.

Maledicta nodded and lay back on the bed.

Kaiden stood up and quickly left the room. As he stepped out into the corridor, he was surprised to see Benedicta standing outside, looking pale and tired. She was shivering, and her eyes seemed sunken.

"Benedicta, are you okay?" Kaiden asked, his voice filled with concern.

Benedicta's eyes locked on his, and she managed to gasp out a few words. "You...spent...the...night...with...her...again." She said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise as Benedicta collapsed, and he quickly caught her before she could hit the ground. He rushed her to the infirmary house, his heart racing with worry.

The healer quickly checked Benedicta over and smiled reassuringly. "It's just a cold. She'll be alright soon." She said.

Kaiden breathed out a sigh of relief and left the infirmary house, his mind whirling with questions. Why was Benedicta outside Maledicta's room so early in the morning? And what was going on with her?As he walked away, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

Aka pushed open the massive wooden doors and stepped into the huge library. The room was filled with rows upon rows of towering bookshelves, each one packed tightly with leather-bound tomes. The air was thick with the musty scent of old books and the flickering light of candles cast eerie shadows on the walls.

Aka's eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face. She spotted Ryder sitting at a table near the back of the room, his nose buried in a thick book. She made her way over to him, her footsteps echoing off the stone floor.

"Hey," she said, dropping into the chair beside him.

Ryder looked up, a smile spreading across his face. "I didn't know you were interested in reading," he said, closing his book.

Aka shook her head. "I'm not, really. I'm just curious about something, and I was hoping you could help me out." She said.

Ryder's eyes lit up with interest. "Sure, I'll do my best. I know all the history in Nightshade, so you've come to the right person." He said.

Aka leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Can you tell me about how Maledicta was cursed?" She asked.

Ryder's expression turned serious, and he glanced around the room to make sure no one was listening. 

"Well, I don't know much about it, but I've heard it was because of her father. He's a demon." He said.

Aka's eyes widened in shock. "Her father is a demon?" She asked.

Ryder nodded, his voice barely above a whisper. "Yeah, I've heard he was cursed by the goddess because of what he did, after he died.The curse was passed down to one of his daughters after they were born. And the unlucky one was Maledicta." He said.

Aka's eyes were wide with fascination. "What happened?"

Ryder leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I've heard the town suffered when she was born. Things went back to normal when her sister was born an hour later. And then Maledicta was sent out of the town."

 "That's so sad." AKa said while making a sad face.

Ryder nodded. "Yeah, it's a pretty tragic story."

Aka's eyes narrowed. "Her father, what did he do?"

Ryder shook his head. "I don't know. We weren't told." He said.

 "You must know about Lucan too."Aka said. 

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise. "How did you know about the demon lord?" He asked.

Aka smiled mischievously. "I overheard some people talking about it, and I was just curious." She said.

Ryder's expression turned serious. "I don't know much about him, but I know he's bad news. He'll bring destruction to the world. Maledicta and Lucan are two powerful people."Ryder said.

Aka nodded thoughtfully. "It's nice talking to you. We should do that more often."

Ryder smiled, and Aka got up to leave. As she walked out of the library, Ryder went back to reading his book.

But he didn't get to read for long. A figure appeared before him, and he looked up to see a strange girl. She had a shy smile on her face, and butterflies seemed to be flying around her head.

"Can I sit beside you?" she asked while staring at his face.

Ryder raised an eyebrow but nodded curtly. "Sure."

The girl sat down, her eyes fixed on him. "I'm Arachne. We're both juniors." She said.

 “Okay” Ryder muttered, not looking up from his book.

Arachne's face fell, but she just smile.

 "So, what are you reading?" she asked, trying to peek at the book.

Ryder's expression turned cold. "None of your business."

Arachne's face turned bright red, and she looked away.

"You're so rude," she scoffed, getting up and storming out of the library.

Ryder watched her go, a mixture of guilt and annoyance on his face. He shook his head and went back to reading his book, trying to forget the awkward encounter.

"Mistress Morwen wants us to keep this at the storage room, and this at the library," Cassius said, pointing at the various items in the office.

Belladonna gazed at the piles of boxes and books, her eyes widening in dismay. 

"This is a huge task. We'll have to pair ourselves up to get it done." She said.

"I'll go to the library. Who's coming with me?" Cassius asked, looking around at the others.

"She's coming with you. I'm going with Lilith."Thane quickly spoke up, pushing Belladonna gently towards Cassius.

Lilith raised an eyebrow, but Thane quickly helped her lift her load, and they set off towards the storage room.

 "What are you doing?"Lilith asked.

Thane glanced at her sideways. "We should give them some privacy. They need to talk things out. Can't you see that?" He asked.

"Did I look like I care?"Lilith scoffed.

Thane's expression turned wry. "That's why you'll never have a partner. You know nothing about romance." He said.

Lilith's face flushed with anger. "You're so rude. I hate your guts. Your brother is better than you in everything." She said.

Thane's eyes clouded over, and he looked away, his voice barely above a whisper. 

"Thank you for reminding me." He muttered.

Lilith's eyes widened in surprise, and she reached out to touch Thane's arm.

 "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that." She said.

Thane didn't respond, but instead quickened his pace, Lilith struggling to keep up with him. They soon arrived at the storage room, and Thane dropped his load with a thud.

Lilith followed suit, and then stood before Thane, her eyes locked on his. 

"I'm sorry, okay? You just keep finding me trouble, I couldn't help myself." She said.

Thane's expression was unreadable, but he started moving closer to Lilith, his eyes fixed on hers. Lilith backed away, her heart racing with anticipation.

"What are you doing?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane didn't respond, but instead reached out to touch her face. Lilith's eyes fluttered closed, her heart pounding in her chest.

Thane's fingers brushed against her hair, removing a stray cotton thread. 

"Are you expecting a kiss?" Thane asked with a smirk. Lilith's eyes snapped open, her face flushing with embarrassment.

Lilith's face turned bright red. "I am not!" she yelled.

 “Why did you close your eyes then?” He smirk.

   “Something fell in” she snapped and push Thane away before turning and running off.

Thane chuckled to himself as he watched her go. "What's wrong with her?" he muttered, shaking his head.

Meanwhile, Cassius and Belladonna had finished arranging the books at the library. Belladonna was about to leave when Cassius suddenly grabbed her arm.

"Are you in love with me?" Cassius asked, his eyes searching hers.

 "We're bonded, we're mates. I can't believe you're asking me this."Belladonna scoffed.

 "To be honest, I didn't feel any bond between us. Why don't you just give up and accept my rejection? I don't feel anything for you." Cassius said seriously.

Belladonna's eyes flashed with anger, and she jerked her arm out of Cassius's grasp. 

"You're unbelievable," she spat, turning and storming off.

Cassius watched her go, a mixture of guilt and relief on his face. He knew he had hurt her, but he couldn't pretend to feel something he didn't.

Kaiden stretched his body wearily, his muscles screaming in protest after a long day of training. He had been practicing sword fighting since morning, and although he was making progress, he was exhausted.

As he walked away from the training grounds, he couldn't help but smile, remembering his night with Maledicta. He felt like he was on top of the world, and nothing could bring him down.

Just as he was about to head back to his room, he heard his name being called. He turned to see Benedicta walking towards him, a bright smile on her face.

"You're supposed to be resting," Kaiden said, raising an eyebrow.

Benedicta pouted, her lower lip jutting out. "I was bored alone. Please, let's have some fun together. We can visit the lake." She pleaded.

Kaiden didn't feel like going, but seeing the sad look on Benedicta's face, he agreed. They walked towards the lake, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and the sound of birds chirping.

As they got closer to the lake, Benedicta suddenly spotted Maledicta sitting beside the water. Her eyes narrowed, and she quickly fell to the ground, pretending to be weak.

Kaiden rushed to her side, concern etched on his face.

 "Are you okay?" he asked, helping her up.

Benedicta gasped, her eyes fluttering closed. "I think I'm weak. I don't think I can walk anymore."

Kaiden sighed, feeling a pang of guilt. "I told you, let's just go back." He said and support her.

 She wrapped her arms around Kaiden's neck, and he was forced to carry her in a bridal style.

As they walked, Benedicta smirked, glancing over at Maledicta, who was watching them with an unreadable expression. Without warning, Benedicta slammed her lips down on Kaiden's, catching him off guard.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock, and he tried to pull away, but Benedicta held tight. Maledicta's eyes seemed to bore into his soul as she watch everything silently.

               (POSSESSIVE)

Kaiden was finally able to release himself from Benedicta's grip, and he dropped her to the ground. She pretended to fall, claiming her leg was weak. Kaiden looked annoyed, his eyes flashing with irritation.

"What was that for?" he asked, his voice firm.

Benedicta smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "I just wanted to do it." She said.

Kaiden's expression turned cold. "You can't do that without my consent. That's not cool." He said.

Benedicta's smile never wavered. "It's nothing." She muttered.

 "Well, to me, it's something. I don't want people misunderstanding the whole thing. Maybe we should just give ourselves a little space." Kaiden said coldly.

Benedicta's smile faltered, and she took a step forward. 

"Why are you overreacting? It's just a kiss." She asked.

Kaiden's voice rose. "That's what you think, but I hate being touched, and you're not even feeling sorry for what you did. What kind of person are you?" He asked.

Benedicta's expression turned sulky, "Okay, I'm sorry. Are we good now?" She muttered.

Kaiden's eyes flashed with anger. He could see she wasn't sincere, and it was obvious she didn't regret what she had done. He turned and left immediately, not even sparing her a glance.

"Kaiden, Kaiden!"Benedicta yelled after him, but he ignored her.

She stood up from the ground, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. She walked towards Maledicta, who was watching the scene unfold.

"You see what happens yourself, so stay away from him," Benedicta said, her voice dripping with malice.

Maledicta raised an eyebrow. "What are you talking about? I see nothing." She muttered.

Benedicta's smile grew wider. "You see the way we kissed, and besides, I met him first, so he belongs to me." She said.

"When did you meet him first? Did you travel to the future or what?"Maledicta's eyes narrowed.

"You yourself know that you should stay away from him. You could rub your bad luck on him. Who knows?" She snapped angrily.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger.

 "I'm just glad you're finally showing your true self. I know that with time, you'll reveal it to everyone. You can't hide it forever” she said.

“For years, I've had to live with being blamed for what you did. I watched you beat a girl to pulp one night, and then I was blamed for it the next morning. They avoided me like the plague, not knowing the real enemy is you." Maledicta added.

"They'll never find out until you're finally out of this school. You're not supposed to be among us, but I pretended you were welcome, and now you want to start taking what's mine and you think i allow that to happen”Benedicta chuckled.

"None of this was ever yours. Have that in your mind." Maledicta said and vanished, leaving Benedicta seething with anger.

Benedicta turned to leave but then spotted a dark figure hiding behind a nearby tree. She vanished and reappeared behind a guy who was peeking out, looking for her. She tapped him on the shoulder, and he turned, his eyes wide with shock.

"Were you eavesdropping?" Benedicta asked, her voice cold and menacing.

The boy shook his head, his body trembling with fear.

 "No, Senior Benedicta, I was just collecting some herbs." He said.

"Why couldn't I believe you?"Benedicta asked with a cold smirk.

The boy tried to run, but Benedicta grabbed his neck, her fingers closing around his throat like a vice. 

"In your next life, don't poke your nose into what doesn't concern you.”she said.

The boy's eyes widened in terror as Benedicta's grip tightened, cutting off his air supply. He struggled and kicked, but it was no use. Benedicta's grip was too strong, and soon, the boy's body went limp.

Benedicta dropped the boy's body to the ground, a look of satisfaction on her face. She lit a fire with her hand and burned the boy's body, erasing all evidence of her crime.

As the flames consumed the boy's body, Benedicta was more angry, she wasn't expecting the type of reaction she has gotten from both Kaiden and Maledicta but she is not ready to give up.

Aka trailed behind Maledicta, her eyes fixed on the girl's back as she walked towards the urge lake. It was early in the morning, and most students were preparing to go to breakfast.

Aka's hand tightened around the little bottle-like pin she was holding, her heart racing with anticipation. She had been waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and now was her chance. She would attack Maledicta from behind, quickly grab her blood with the pin, and then vanish into thin air. It was a foolproof plan.

As Maledicta approached the lake, Aka tiptoed closer, her footsteps silent on the grass. She was almost within striking distance when Maledicta suddenly turned around, her eyes locking onto Aka's.

Aka tried to vanish, but Maledicta was too quick. She reached out with one hand and grabbed Aka, lifting her off the ground with ease. Aka struggled and kicked, but Maledicta's grip was like a vice.

With a swift motion, Maledicta threw Aka away, sending her crashing into the tree. Aka's back hit the stone with a sickening crunch, and she groaned in pain as her backbone broke.

Maledicta took deadly steps towards Aka, her eyes blazing with anger.

 "You're getting on my nerves," she muttered coldly.

Aka was already bleeding from her ears, nose, and mouth, but she tried to plead for mercy. 

"I'm sorry, I just wanted to greet you. Please don't hurt me." She said.

Maledicta's expression didn't change. 

"This is your last warning. Anytime you approach me again, I will not spare you." She said and with that, Maledicta turned and started leaving, leaving Aka to writhe in pain on the ground. Aka's vision began to blur, and she knew it would take a long time for her to heal herself.
But Aka's hatred for Maledicta burned brighter than ever.

Ryder walked into the library, his eyes scanning the room.He spotted Arachne sitting at a corner table, her nose buried in a book. Ryder remembered their previous encounter and felt a pang of guilt. He had been rude to her, and now he wanted to make amends.

He approached her table, clearing his throat to announce his presence. 

"Hey, what are you doing?" he asked, sitting down opposite her.

Arachne glanced up, her eyes narrowing slightly when she saw Ryder. She returned to her book, ignoring him.

Ryder raised an eyebrow. "Did you just ignore me?" he asked, his voice tinged with amusement.

Arachne looked up again, her expression unreadable.

 "Who are you?" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain.

“Wow, have you forget about me?” he asked.
 
 “I did not,  you're the one who was talking about my favorite person(Maledicta). I approached you because I was curious, but you ignored me. Did you know who I am?" She snapped.

Ryder shook his head. "No, I don't. And what's with the butterflies flying around your head?" He asked.

Arachne's face turned red with anger. "I am Princess Arachne, a flower fairy. My father is the king of the fairies' town, and I am his only daughter. I'm surprised you didn't know about me." She scoffed.

 "Oh, I've never heard of you."Ryder smirked.

"You're going to be punished for that when I get married. My future husband is the crown prince of the Nightshade city." She said.

Ryder's eyes widened in shock. "What? Future husband?" He asked.

Arachne smiled, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Of course, I was told during the festival." She said.

Ryder's expression turned incredulous. "Why are you happy about it? You don't even know him." He said.

Arachne's smile never wavered. "I don't know him, but people say he's very handsome and nice. I couldn't wait to meet him." She giggles.

"You're unbelievable."Ryder scoffed.

Arachne's eyes narrowed. "Why do you look annoyed? Are you jealous?" She asked.

"No, no," Ryder snapped, standing up and storming out of the library.

As he walked away, he couldn't believe what he had just heard. His parents had betrothed him to some princess without even asking him first. He felt a wave of anger wash over him, and he couldn't wait to confront his parents about it.

Benedicta walked towards Kaiden's room, her mind preoccupied with thoughts of their last encounter. She hadn't spoken to him since the incident, and she wasn't sure how to approach him.

Just as she was about to reach his room, she saw Aka entering the forest. Benedicta's curiosity was piqued - where was Aka always sneaking off to?

Without hesitation, Benedicta followed Aka, careful to keep a safe distance. Aka seemed to know exactly where she was going, navigating the forest with ease.

As they walked, the trees grew taller and the air grew thick with an eerie energy. Benedicta could feel that they were approaching something sinister.

Suddenly, Aka vanished out of the school grounds, and Benedicta followed suit. They soon found themselves standing in front of a cave, the entrance guarded by twisted, gnarled trees.

Benedicta watched as Aka entered the cave, the demons inside bowing down to her. Benedicta's eyes widened in surprise - what was Aka's connection to these creatures?

She made herself invisible and followed Aka into the cave. The air inside was thick with the stench of decay and corruption. Benedicta's stomach churned as she took in the twisted, nightmarish landscape.

As they walked deeper into the cave, Benedicta saw all manner of creepy demons, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy. She gasped and hid behind a stone, her heart racing with fear.

But then she saw Queen Epusa, her presence commanding attention. Aka called out to her, "Mum!" and Benedicta's eyes widened in shock.

"Are you here with the blood?" Epusa asked coldly.

Aka shook her head. "I couldn't, she's just too smart. I don't know what to do, but I'm definitely not giving up." She said.

Epusa's smile sent shivers down Benedicta's spine. 

"I've found out that Lucan is no longer in the future. He could be anywhere in this world." Epusa said.

"Mum, I promise I'll either bring Maledicta's blood or bring the real Lucan to you. I have to avenge Dad's death."Aka said.

Epusa's eyes seemed to gleam with malevolence.

 "The real Lucan has a mark on his back. It was supposed to be on his forehead, but it moved to his back after his power was sealed. So, you can watch those male students - he could be among them." Epusa said.

 "I promise, Mum."Aka nodded.

As Aka turned to leave, she suddenly stopped.

 "That girl - I've learned she's as powerful as Lucan. What if they come together? What will happen?" She asked curiously.

 "They can never come together. It's too dangerous. They're two opposite people. Don't even think about it." Epusa said.

Aka nodded, though Benedicta could sense a hint of curiosity in her voice. 

"Okay, Mother. I should go back to school before I'm noticed."she said.

As Aka left the cave, Benedicta followed, a smile spreading across her face. She was happy to have discovered this secret, and she was already thinking of ways to use it to her advantage.

The moon hung low in the sky, its full, red face casting an eerie glow over the landscape. It was the Lover's Moon, a night when passion and desire ruled supreme. Everywhere was quiet, as if the world itself was holding its breath in anticipation of the night's events.

Lovers couldn't stop getting into each other's arms, their passion fueled by the moon's potent energy. It was a night when inhibitions were shed, and desires were indulged.

Belladonna was lost in thought, her mind preoccupied with the events of the day. She was startled by a sudden knock on her door. She got up to answer it, wondering who could be visiting at such a late hour.

She opened the door to find Cassius standing before her, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity. Belladonna's heart skipped a beat as she took in the sight of him.

"Cassius, what are you doing here this late?" she asked, trying to sound calm despite the turmoil brewing inside her.

But before she could react further, a deep, husky voice spoke up, "Mate."

Belladonna's eyes widened in shock as she realized that Cassius's wolf, Cass, had emerged. Cass was a powerful, primal force that took over Cassius's body during times of intense passion or danger.

"Cass," Belladonna muttered, her voice barely audible.

Cassius's eyes seemed to gleam with a feral light as he took a step closer to Belladonna. 

"I really want you now," he growled, his voice low and husky.

Before Belladonna could react, Cassius slammed his lips down on hers, his kiss fierce and demanding. Belladonna tried to push him away, but her body seemed to weaken, as if the Red Moon's energy was sapping her strength.

She knew she should resist, but her body seemed to have a mind of its own. She felt herself reciprocating the kiss, her passion fueled by the moon's potent energy.

As they kissed, their clothes seemed to disappear, leaving them naked and vulnerable. Cassius's hands roamed over Belladonna's body, his touch sending shivers down her spine.

They stumbled backwards, their lips still locked together, until they fell onto the bed. The room around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, lost in a sea of passion and desire.

Lilith and Thane were seated in Mistress Morwen's office, surrounded by piles of papers and quills. They were tasked with helping the Mistress write some reports, a job that neither of them was particularly enthusiastic about.

Lilith gazed out the window, her eyes scanning the night sky.

 "It's a red moon," she said, her voice tinged with a hint of wistfulness.

Thane looked up from his writing, his eyes meeting Lilith's. 

"I know. I can't believe others are having fun, but we're stuck here writing this boring report." He said.

Lilith sighed, her shoulders slumping in defeat. "I think we'll forever remain single. Who wants to be stuck with someone as boring as us?" She said,

 "Speak for yourself." Thanos, Thane wolf suddenly said.

Thane chuckled, a low, rumbling sound. 

  “What is funny?” Lilith asked with a frown.

"Nothing, just continue with what you're doing." Thane said.

  “Jerk” she scoffed.

Kaiden tossed and turned on his bed, unable to shake off the thoughts of Maledicta that had been plaguing him all night. He had tried to sleep, but his mind kept wandering back to what happened. and the guilt that had been eating away at him.

He hadn't spoken to her since the incident with Benedicta.

Finally, unable to take it anymore, Kaiden threw off his covers and got out of bed. He made his way to Maledicta's room, the red moon still shining brightly in the sky.

He knocked gently on the door, and when it opened, he took a deep breath before entering. Maledicta was laying on her bed, though she wasn't asleep. She looked up at him, her eyes gleaming in the moonlight.

"I thought you wouldn't come," she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden took a step closer to her, his heart pounding in his chest.

 "I want to tell you something," he said, his voice shaking slightly.

Maledicta sat up straight, her eyes fixed on his. 

"What is it?" she asked.

Kaiden took a deep breath before speaking. 

"Yesterday, something happened. I was with..." He stopped, unable to continue, as he saw the look on Maledicta's face.

She was staring at him, her eyes piercing and intense. Kaiden felt like he was drowning in their depths, unable to look away.

"We...we...kissed" he stuttered, feeling like he was confessing to a crime.

But to his surprise, Maledicta's expression didn't change. She didn't look angry or hurt, just calm and collected.

"You don't have to tell me if you can't say it," she said.

Kaiden felt a wave of relief wash over him. "Really?" he asked, his voice full of gratitude.

Maledicta nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. "Yeah, I overlooked everything."

She opened her arms, and Kaiden felt like he was being pulled into a warm embrace. He hugged her back, feeling like he was home.

"I like you so much, Maledicta," he said, his voice muffled against her shoulder.

Maledicta's arms tightened around him. 

"Does that mean we're lovers?" she asked, her voice teasing.

Kaiden pulled back, looking into her eyes.

 "Yeah, we are," he said.
Maledicta's face lit up with a radiant smile. 

"Now I won't allow any of those girls around you, because you belong to me only. You're mine," she muttered, her voice possessive.

Kaiden felt a shiver run down his spine as he looked into her eyes.

            (RED HANDED)

Belladonna slowly turned around, her eyes widening in surprise as she found herself in Cassius's arms. For a moment, she thought maybe what had happened the previous night was just a dream, but the reality of the situation quickly set in.

She blushed and stared at Cassius's face, taking in the sharp angles and chiseled features that made him look so handsome and innocent. She couldn't help herself; she reached out and gently traced her hand over his smooth face, feeling the warmth of his skin beneath her fingertips.

As she touched him, she could hear the sound of her heart beating loudly against her ribcage, and she felt a flutter in her chest. It was as if she was awakening to a new reality, one where she was connected to Cassius in a way she couldn't quite understand.

Just as she was lost in the moment, Cassius suddenly stirred from his sleep, and Belladonna quickly removed her hand, feeling a rush of embarrassment. She watched as he opened his eyes, confusion etched on his face.

"Good morning," she muttered, trying to sound casual despite the turmoil brewing inside her.

Cassius looked around, taking in his surroundings, before his eyes landed on Belladonna. He was confused for a moment before he finally regained his senses. He sprang out of bed, looking shocked and disoriented.

"What am I doing here?" he asked, staring at his naked form in horror. He quickly grabbed his clothes and started putting them on, his movements jerky and agitated.

Belladonna watched him, feeling a pang of guilt and embarrassment. 

"You suddenly showed up here yesterday, calling me your mate, and then you made a move on me," she explained, trying to keep her voice steady.

Cassius's expression turned angry, "I would never do that! What are you talking about?"he snapped.

Belladonna took a deep breath before continuing. "It was Cass, your wolf. He came here, and I couldn't stop him." She said.

Cassius's face darkened, "That horny bastard."he muttered under his breath.

 "Don't curse at me," Cass snapped inside Cassius head.

"Just shut up, did you know what you just did?" Cassius said his voice rising in anger.

"I did nothing wrong,She is our mate, and I just regret the fact that I didn't mark her." Cassius's wolf, Cass, snapped back in his head. 

Cassius's expression turned even darker,  "Just leave me alone, don't talk to me again." He said 

He locked Cass out of his head,  Cassius turned to face Belladonna, his eyes cold and unforgiving.

"You know he's not me, and you still slept with him," he said, his voice dripping with disgust. 

"How could you? Did you think this would ever change anything? It changes nothing. I won't ever see you as my mate." He said not caring how she take his word.

Belladonna felt a pang of pain and regret.

"Cassius, I'm sorry," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"I really tried to stop him, but yesterday was the red moon. It was very difficult for me. Please don't be angry with me." She pleaded and grab his hand.

Cassius's expression didn't change, and he pulled his hand away from hers.

 "I don't want to listen to your excuses," he said, his voice cold and detached.

 "I'm so disappointed. If Cass had marked you, you would have tied me down when I feel nothing for you." He said, With that, he turned and left, banging the door behind him. Belladonna felt a wave of despair wash over her, and she finally let her tears fall. She felt dirty, unholy, and weak.

She cleaned her tears, picked up her clothes, and went into the bathroom to shower. As she stood under the warm water, she couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her and Cassius. Had she ruined her chances with him forever? Only time would tell.

Maledicta snuggled deeper into Kaiden's arm, feeling a sense of comfort and security she had never experienced before. Kaiden started caressing her hair, his touch sending shivers down her spine.

"Thank you for accepting me last night," he said, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. But her smile disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, and she suddenly turned away from Kaiden.

"What's wrong?" Kaiden asked gently, turning her to face him.

Maledicta's eyes dropped, and she stared at the floor. "I could really be bad for you, Kaiden. I don't deserve to have people around me." She said.

Kaiden's expression turned concerned. "What are you talking about? I was made to be by your side." He said.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with a mixture of pain and guilt. 

"You don't understand. I had a friend ten years ago. Her name was Amaya. She was a beautiful fairy. I ignored her at first, but she didn't give up. She became my first-ever friend. I was so happy to have someone to talk to." She started gently.

Maledicta's voice cracked, and she paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.

"Then something happened one night. I was unconscious, and by the time I woke up, Amaya's dead body was beside me. My hand was filled with blood. I killed her, my only friend." She said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock. "You can't say that. You're not sure if you killed her." He said.

Maledicta's expression turned bleak. "I did. It was obvious.I couldn't even cry after her death, people see me as heartless beast So, you still have a chance to stay away." She said.

"I'm not staying away. I'm your pill, remember? You can't live without me." Kaiden said.

Maledicta laughed, a hint of sadness still lingering in her eyes. The two of them shared a deep, passionate kiss, their lips locked together.

Their kiss was interrupted by a knock on the door.

 "Maledicta, I know you're in there. Open this door now!" Belladonna's voice came from outside.

Maledicta and Kaiden sprang out of bed, their eyes wide with alarm. 

“Why aren't you saying anything” Belladonna voice came again.

    “Why is she here this early?” Kaiden asked his eyes widen.  Maledicta quickly closed her eyes and started chanting some words.

   “I am coming in” Belladonna said and started opening the door.

Kaiden disappeared, and Belladonna entered the room, a smirk on her face. 

"Are you hiding something?" she asked, her eyes scanning the room.

Maledicta took a deep breath, her expression calm and composed. "No, what are you doing here?" She asked.

Belladonna's smirk grew wider. "We're friends, and we haven't talked for a day. Don't you miss me?" He asked.

 "I don't." Maledicta muttered plainly.

Belladonna's grin faltered for a moment before she recovered. "You're so honest. Hurry up and take your bath. You're eating breakfast at the hall today, and then you'll train the juniors. They need to know you're not as scary as they thought." She said and started pushing her toward the bathroom.

 "You look sad. What's wrong with you?" Maledicta suddenly asked.

Belladonna's grin returned, but it looked forced this time. 

"Wow, are you worried about me?" She smile trying to hide her sadness.

 "Just forget I asked you." Maledicta said and enter the bathroom leaving Belladonna alone in the room. The smile on Belladonna's face disappeared, and she looked like she was about to cry. But she refrained herself, taking a deep breath to compose herself.

As she stood there, she couldn't help but think about what Cassius had told her. She felt a pang of sadness and regret, but she pushed it aside, not wanting to dwell on it.
.

.
.
The students were all training, their sweat-drenched faces a testament to the intensity of their workouts. Maledicta was training a group of girls.

At first, the girls had been awkward and afraid, intimidated by Maledicta's reputation and fearsome appearance. But as the training session wore on, they began to relax, their movements becoming more confident and assured.

Aka sat at a corner, her eyes fixed intently on Maledicta. She still hadn't figured out a way to get a drop of Maledicta's blood, a task that seemed increasingly difficult as the days went by.

"You seem really interested in Senior Maledicta."Ryder's voice interrupted her thoughts.

Aka finally looked away from Maledicta, her eyes meeting Ryder's.

 "Let's say, I adore her," she said, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.

"Well, you're not the only one."Ryder chuckled.

Aka's eyes narrowed slightly, "You must be talking about her," she said, pointing to Arachne, who was following Maledicta around the training area, her eyes fixed adoringly on the older girl.

"Yeah."Ryder nodded.

Aka's gaze returned to Maledicta, "I'm just so curious about her." She said gently.

Ryder's expression turned thoughtful, "About that, I think I could find a way." He muttered.

Aka's eyes snapped back to Ryder, "Really?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ryder nodded, "Yeah. When I visited my grandfather about a year ago, I found an old history book about Maledicta's father in his safe. I wanted to read it, but he took it away, saying the story wasn't suitable for young ears." He said.

Aka's eyes widened, "What do you mean?" She asked.

Ryder leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I think the older ones know what really happened to Maledicta's father, but they won't tell us. They're keeping secrets, and I think that book might hold the key." He said.

 "Are you trying to say you should sneak into your grandfather's safe and take the book?" Aka asked after some minutes.

Ryder nodded, "Yeah. He lives near here, and we'll have a free day soon. I could sneak out of the school and come back before anyone notices." He said.

 "I'll come with you." She said.

"Sure. I'll tell you when I'm ready."Ryder grinned.

As Ryder left, Aka couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. She was one step closer to uncovering the secrets surrounding Maledicta, and she was determined to see it through.

"Soon, I'll know what really happened," Aka whispered to herself, a smile spreading across her face.
.
.
.

Thane watched Kaiden with a mixture of surprise and curiosity. 

"You haven't been messing up in today's training. What's going on with you?" he asked, eyeing Kaiden's focused expression.

"It's nothing, I'm just showing your effort on me, senior."Kaiden grinned.

Thane raised an eyebrow. "You smile a lot too."

Kaiden's grin faltered for a moment, and he looked away, his cheeks flushing. 

"I always smile, okay?" he muttered, trying to sound nonchalant.

Thane chuckled, shaking his head. "Whatever, kid."

Kaiden's eyes drifted toward Maledicta, who was training a group of girls. He watched her, mesmerized by her fluid movements and deadly precision.

Just then, Benedicta appeared on the training ground, a huge box beside her. "I know you're all tired, so I made this juice from the best flowers. It will give you strength," she announced, her smile bright and cheerful.

The juniors cheered, gathering around Benedicta to pick up the juice. 

"Thank you, senior," they said, taking a sip of the juice.

    “You must tired sis,have a Drink” Benedicta handed one to Maledicta, who hesitated for a moment before accepting it.

Belladonna appeared beside Benedicta and also pick one.

 "You're really playing this game, two-face." She whispered to Benedicta.

Benedicta's smile never wavered, but her eyes flashed with anger. She watched as Belladonna took a drink and walked away.

Cassius, meanwhile, was struggling to focus on his training session with the juniors. His eyes kept drifting toward Maledicta, who was training others.

He couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he had a chance with her.

Lilith, who was standing beside Cassius, was lost in her own little world. She was talking to an imaginary boyfriend, her eyes shining with excitement.

"I know, right? I'm so excited for our date tonight," she said, giggling.

Cassius raised an eyebrow, amused by Lilith's antics. "Lilith, there's no one there."

“Mind your business." She snapped.

Thane, who was watching the exchange, chuckled. "Don't mind her, Cassius. She's just a little...out there." He said.

Lilith glare at him while he just laughed more.

“Both of you are  jerks” she said and left.
.
.
.
.

It was after dinner, and Kaiden made his way to Maledicta's room, eager to spend some quality time with her. The door opened, and Maledicta immediately hugged him, her arms wrapping tightly around his waist.

"I'm so tired," she said, her voice muffled against his chest. "I just want to spend the rest of the day with you."

Kaiden smiled, feeling a warmth spread through his chest.

 "Me too," he said, holding her cheeks in his palms. He started leaning in, his lips inches from hers, when a knock on the door distracted them.

"Maledicta, are you in?" Belladonna's voice came from outside.

Kaiden groaned, feeling frustrated. "Why is she always disturbing us?" he muttered.

Maledicta pulled back, a mischievous glint in her eye. 

"Let's just go to your room," she said, holding his hand. They both vanished, reappearing in Kaiden's room.

But their peace was short-lived. Almost immediately, a knock sounded on Kaiden's door.

"Kaiden!" Ryder's voice came from outside.

Maledicta groaned, rolling her eyes. "Why is this happening?" she asked, exasperated.

Kaiden thought for a moment before a solution came to him. 

"Let's go to the training ground. That's the only place I know we won't see any students. Go, I'll meet you there." He said.

Maledicta nodded, vanishing into thin air. Kaiden opened the door, and Ryder came in, looking curious.

"Why did you take so long?" Ryder asked.

Kaiden shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. 

"I was just preparing. I have to go for training." He said.

Ryder raised an eyebrow. "Again? Aren't you tired?" He asked.

Kaiden shook his head. "I'm not."

Ryder looked skeptical, but Kaiden didn't give him a chance to ask more questions. He took off running, leaving Ryder behind.

"The seniors always train themselves at night," He yelled after Kaiden but he was already gone.

  “He is so suspicous lately” Ryder muttered to himself, shaking his head. He went back to his room, looking thoughtful.

Meanwhile, Kaiden ran into the training ground, his eyes scanning the area until he spotted Maledicta pacing around. He grinned, feeling a sense of excitement.

"Finally, a quiet time," he said, hugging her tightly.

 "I've been wishing to have you in my arms since morning." He added.

"Me too."Maledicta smiled.

Kaiden's eyes locked onto hers, his voice taking on a serious tone.

 "Let's build a private place for ourselves, a place where only we know about. We could have fun, do a lot of things and no one will disturb us" he said gently.

Maledicta's smile grew wider. "Let's do it." She said.

They started kissing, Kaiden's hands roaming around Maledicta's body. But their moment of intimacy was short-lived.

"What did I just see?" Thane's voice said, his tone shocked.

"Tell me I'm dreaming," Lilith said, her voice equally stunned.

"What the hell?" Belladonna yelled, her voice piercing through the air.

Kaiden and Maledicta quickly disengaged, looking around in shock. They were met with a sea of faces, all of whom looked like they had just seen a ghost. The senior were staring at them.

Cassius looked like he was about to faint, his eyes fixed on Kaiden and Maledicta with a mixture of shock and horror. Benedicta's face was red with anger, her eyes blazing with fury.

Kaiden and Maledicta stood frozen, unsure of what to say or do. They had been caught red-handed, and they knew that their secret was out.

              (RED FLAME)

Benedicta's voice echoed through the training grounds, her anger and shock palpable. 

"What are you both doing?" she yelled, her heart beating loudly in her chest.

Maledicta couldn't bear to look up, her eyes fixed on the ground. She vanished into thin air, leaving Kaiden to face the music alone.

The seniors turned their attention to Kaiden, their eyes blazing with curiosity and shock. Kaiden stood tall, trying to appear confident despite the nervous smile spreading across his face.

"We were just training," he said, trying to downplay the situation.

 "She was teaching me some moves." He added.

Lilith raised an eyebrow,  "Do you think we're kids? We saw everything, so just tell us the truth." She said.

Kaiden took a deep breath, his eyes scanning the crowd before meeting Lilith's gaze. 

"She's my girlfriend, okay?" he said, his voice firm.

The room fell silent, the only sound the collective gasp of the seniors. Thane's eyes widened in confusion. "What is that?" he asked, his voice laced with innocence.

Kaiden's smile faltered for a moment before he replied, "We're together, I mean, as lovers."

The room erupted into a flurry of gasps and whispers, the seniors exchanging shocked glances. Lilith's eyes sparkled with excitement.

 "You're not kidding, right?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden shook his head, a smile spreading across his face. "Why would I lie about that?"

Belladonna's face lit up with a bright smile. "Amazing, I knew something was off. I'm so happy to hear this." She said.

Thane nodded in agreement. "Me too. She's finally loosening up." He said.

Cassius stormed off, his face twisted in anger, shock and hurt, Benedicta followed suit, her eyes blazing with fury.

Kaiden bowed, his face flushing with embarrassment. "I'll go to my room now." He said.

 "He's so special." Lilith said as she watch him go.

 "Right. I noticed that the first day I saw him." Thane said beside her.

Lilith's expression turned cold, and she scoffed, "I wasn't talking to you." She said and storm off.

“I wasn’t talking to you either” Thane yelled after her.

"When are you two going to stop being cat and dog?" Belladonna asked while shaking her head.

"Don't know. Maybe when she finally gets a real man in her life."Thane grinned.

Belladonna chuckled, and the two of them left the training grounds together.

As the seniors dispersed, Thane turn to Belladonna, 

"I can see you're a bit sad today. I hope my brother didn't hurt you?" He said with a bit of concern in his eyes.

Belladonna's smile faltered for a moment before she replied, "He didn't."

Thane's eyes narrowed, his expression skeptical. But he didn't push the issue, instead watching as Belladonna walked ahead.
As he retired to his room, Thane couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Belladonna's smile had seemed forced, and her eyes had looked sad.

“I hope she is okay” he muttered to himself.
.
.
.

Belladonna shook Maledicta on the bed, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. 

"Wake up, sleeping beauty." She yelled.

"I wasn't sleeping."Maledicta muttered without opening her eyes.

Belladonna chuckled. "Get up, it's morning. We have a place to go after breakfast." She said.

Maledicta finally stood up from the bed, stretching her arms before opening her eyes.

 "Where's that?" she asked.

Belladonna's grin grew wider. "Anywhere except your room. We could go to the library, garden, lake, or just stroll around, let just hang out together today, you need to learn a lot of things about dating a man." Maledicta said.

Maledicta raised an eyebrow. "How's the situation outside?" she asked.

 "Well, everyone knows about your relationship already. Let's just say some seniors can't keep secrets." Belladonna said.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed. "I'm not going out. I'm going to get too much attention." She said and lay back down on the bed.

Belladonna's expression turned teasing. "Are you nervous? Wow, you're really changing. Kaiden is really amazing." She said.

Maledicta's face turned cold. "You don't understand me." She said.

 "You just ignore their stares, pretend not to see them, and do your thing. You're good at doing that, remember?" Belladonna said and push her back up.

Maledicta's expression remained skeptical, but she eventually nodded. "Fine."

The two of them left Maledicta's room, and as they walked through the corridors, it became clear that the news of Maledicta's relationship with Kaiden had spread like wildfire. Students whispered and pointed, their eyes fixed on Maledicta with a mixture of curiosity and awe.

When they arrived at the dining hall, Maledicta scanned the room, her eyes searching for Kaiden. But he was nowhere to be found. She joined the seniors instead, focusing on her food and trying to ignore the stares.

Belladonna, meanwhile, was a little worried about Cassius's absence. She shrugged it off, thinking that he might just be running late. But as the meal went on, and Cassius still didn't show up, Belladonna's concern grew.
.
.
.

Kaiden walked through the hallway, aware of the attention and whispering that followed him. He didn't need anyone to tell him what they were talking about; he knew that his relationship with Maledicta was the hottest topic of gossip in the school.

As he turned a corner, he saw Benedicta approaching him, a smile on her face. He waited for her, feeling a sense of trepidation. He knew that Benedicta was Maledicta's sister, and he wasn't sure how she would react to the news of their relationship.

"Morning," Benedicta muttered.

Kaiden smiled, feeling a sense of relief. "About last night, I'm so sorry," he said gently.

Benedicta smile.

"Why are you apologizing?" she asked.

Kaiden took a deep breath,  "Because I should have told you instead of you finding out the way you did. We're friends, and I shouldn't have kept the fact that I like your sister a secret." He said.

Benedicta's smile disappeared for a moment, and Kaiden wondered if he had misjudged her reaction. But then her smile returned, and she looked at him.

"You don't have to apologize, okay? I just regret walking away yesterday. I shouldn't have done that." She said gently.

Kaiden felt a sense of relief wash over him. "So you're not angry?" he asked.

Benedicta shook her head,  "I'm not. I'm glad my sister finally has someone by her side. She's been alone since the death of her friend Amaya."Benedicta said expecting him to ask questions but was both shock and angry when he didn't.

"Thank you for understanding,We can continue to be friends, and I'm always here for you." He said with a smile and give her a little hug.

Benedicta's smile grew wider, and she nodded. "I appreciate that." She said.

As Kaiden walked away, Benedicta change to anger as she watch his back.

“You are mine fool” she muttered and started walking slowly behind.

He  join Ryder in the seat he had reserved for him.

Ryder looked up at him, a grin on his face. "Is what I'm hearing about you really true?" he asked immediately he sat down beside him.

Kaiden nodded, "Sure."

Ryder's eyes widened in shock. "Wow, how did you win her heart?" he asked.

Kaiden shrugged,"I didn't know, to be honest." He said.

Ryder laughed, clapping him on the back. "You're so lucky, man. I respect you from now on." He said.

Kaiden rolled his eyes, "Stop exaggerating." He said.

Just then, Benedicta walked into the room, joining the seniors. She smiled at Maledicta. She couldn't wait to show her what she has in store for her.

"I actually thought she would be the one you'd end up with,"Ryder said while pointing at Benedicta.

Kaiden shrugged, "I've never even thought of her that way." Kaiden  said.
.
.
.
.

Kaiden's heart was racing as he followed the guy who had come to inform him that Mistress Morwen wanted to see him. This was the first time he had been summoned to her presence, and he couldn't help but wonder what was wrong.

The guy led him to a large, ornate door, and nodded for Kaiden to enter. Kaiden took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and stepped inside.

The room was dimly lit, with only a few candles flickering to light the space. Mistress Morwen was seated on a throne-like chair, her eyes fixed intently on Kaiden. She stood up immediately as he entered, a warm smile spreading across her face.

"I'm so glad you came," she said, her voice dripping with sincerity.

Kaiden felt a surge of nervousness, unsure of how to respond. "Thank you," he muttered, trying to sound confident.

Mistress Morwen's just smile, "Are the rumors I heard true? Are you really with my daughter?" she asked, her voice tinged with curiosity.

Kaiden's heart skipped a beat as he hesitated, unsure of how to answer. .

"I am," he said nervously.

To his surprise, Mistress Morwen's face lit up with a bright smile. 

"Thank you so much, boy," she said.

 "You don't know what you've done for my daughter. I never thought a moment like this would come, when she would finally start living her life." She said.

 "I think she's the one who did a lot for me,She saved me and brought me to this amazing place. What else could I ask for?" Kaiden said gently.

Mistress Morwen's smile grew wider. "If you want anything, you can always come to me. I'm ready to give you whatever you want." She said.

Kaiden shook his head, "I don't need anything, I love your daughter so much. I just need your support." He said sincerely.

 "You have my full support, you're free, okay?" Mistress Morwen quickly said.

Kaiden smiled, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. "Thank you, ma'am."

He left the room, feeling elated and relieved. Things were finally going well for him.

As he walked down the corridor, he spotted Aka heading somewhere. He quickened his pace, catching up to her.

Aka was startled when she saw him, and she quickly turned around to check if Benedicta was watching. Kaiden raised an eyebrow, confused.

"What are you looking for?" he asked.

Aka's expression turned cold. "Stay away from me." She snapped and started leaving.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "Huh? Why?" He asked.

But Aka was already gone, disappearing around the corner. Kaiden stood there, feeling bewildered.

"Wow, did that just happen?" he asked himself, shaking his head. He couldn't understand why Aka was suddenly acting strange around him.He shrugged it off and continued on his way.

The air at the school was filled with giggling and tears as the students received letters written to them by their parents and loved ones. The atmosphere was bittersweet, with some students beaming with joy while others looked crestfallen.

Thane sat at a corner in the library, the only student there. He wasn't reading or studying; he just sat there, staring blankly into space. His eyes looked empty, his face a mask of sadness.

"Why are you here?"Lilith's voice broke the silence.

Thane didn't look up, his voice barely above a whisper. "I should be the one asking you that, because this was supposed to be my comfort zone." He said.

Lilith walked closer, her eyes fixed on Thane's slumped figure. "It was my comfort zone too." She said.

Thane finally looked up, his eyes meeting Lilith's. "We can't help running into each other, can we? Just sit down too, don't let us disturb one another" he muttered, a hint of resignation in his voice.

Lilith's expression softened, her voice taking on a gentle tone. "What's wrong with you? Why are you so down?" She asked.

Thane's gaze dropped, and he opened the letter in his hand. His eyes scanned the pages, his face twisting in pain.

"For once, I was expecting something different, but nothing's changed," he said, his voice cracking.

 "All they ask about in this letter is my brother. They didn't even care how I'm faring. They asked me to take care of him, but he's the one who's supposed to take care of me since he's the older one." Thane said sadly.

Thane's voice broke, and he struggled to hold back tears. "Am I not their son too? Why are they hurting me so much? They didn't even care about me.it wasn't my fault I came at the wrong time, i tried to ignore it but it hurt so much" he said.

Lilith's eyes filled with compassion, and she sat down beside Thane.

 "I can understand," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

 "I didn't receive any letter from my parents either. They hate me; they blame me for my older sister's death." She added sadly.

Thane's eyes met Lilith's, and they shared a moment before looking away.

 "We're just losers," Thane said, a bitter smile twisting his lips.

 "We're not losers. They just don't know our worth."Lilith said seriously.

Thane's smile faltered, and he looked away, his eyes welling up with tears.

 "We have so much in common," he said, his voice barely audible.

Lilith nodded, her eyes shining with tears. "Yeah, totally."

They both laughed sadly, the sound echoing through the empty library. 

“Can they ever know our worth, can they understand us?” Thane asked.

   “I don't know, time will tell” Lilith said and they both went silent.

Ryder's eyes scanned the letter, his expression growing increasingly somber. His parents wanted him to return to the palace in a few days. They didn't specify why, but Ryder knew. He knew that they were going to tell him about the girl they had betrothed to him without his permission.

Ryder's jaw clenched in frustration as he crumpled the letter in his hand. He felt a surge of anger and resentment towards his parents. 
He stood up and threw the letter out the window, watching as it fluttered away in the wind. Then, he lay down on his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Meanwhile, Arachne was bouncing around the room, her face alight with excitement. She had just received a letter, and she couldn't stop grinning. She was going to finally meet her betrothed.

"I'm going to finally see his face!" she squealed, jumping up and down on the bed.

"I've been waiting for this moment for so long! I wonder what he's going to be like. Is he going to be handsome? Will he like me?" She thought to herself.

Arachne lay down on the bed, still grinning from ear to ear. She couldn't stop giggling.

Belladonna didn't want to, but she found herself walking towards Cassius's room. He hadn't come out of his room since morning, and she was curious. She knocked on the door for a while, but didn't get any response. Her concern grew, and she decided to open the door and enter.

As she stepped inside, she gasped in shock. Cassius was lying on the ground, surrounded by empty pots of alcohol. She rushed towards him, helping him up. He reeked of alcohol, and his eyes were glazed over.

"You could get in trouble for drinking alcohol in school," Belladonna said worriedly, trying to keep her tone light. "What came over you?"

Cassius chuckled, his eyes taking on a faraway look.

 "You wouldn't say anything, right?" he slurred.

Belladonna's expression turned stern. "Cassius, you have to get back to your senses. This isn't like you." She said.

But Cassius's expression turned bitter, his eyes filling with tears. He suddenly cupped Belladonna's cheeks, his grip tight.

"How could you do that to me?" he asked drunkenly, his voice cracking with emotion. 

"How could you choose that human over me? I've been by your side forever, and you went ahead and chose him. How could you?" He said.

Belladonna's eyes filled with tears, her heart aching with sadness. She was sad that Cassius was in pain because of another girl, while she was in pain because of him.

"You're so pathetic," Belladonna said, her voice trembling with tears. And help him to his bed.

Cassius's face contorted in pain, and he dragged Belladonna down to the bed with him. He wrapped his arms around her, holding her close.

"Stay with me, Maledicta," he whispered into her ear, his breath hot and alcohol-laced.

Belladonna's tears poured down, her heart breaking into a million pieces. She realized in that moment that she was tired of waiting for Cassius, tired of being in love with someone who didn't love her back.

She made up her mind immediately; she was done waiting. She was done loving Cassius. She gently pushed him away, trying to extricate herself from his grasp.

But Cassius held on tight, his eyes closed in a drunken stupor. Belladonna sighed, feeling a sense of resignation wash over her. She would have to wait until Cassius sobered up to have a proper conversation with him.

Maledicta walked back from the lake, the moon casting a silver glow over the tranquil water. She loved spending time alone there, finding solace in the peaceful atmosphere. But as the night wore on, she knew she had to return to her room. 

   Most students have already retied to their room since the dangers of staying out late were well-known.

As she walked, the trees seemed to loom over her, casting long, ominous shadows on the ground, as she was getting near her room.

Suddenly, Benedicta appeared in front of her, her face twisted in anger. 

"I told you to stay away from him, but you went ahead and made him yours. How could you?" she yelled, her voice echoing through the night air.

"He was mine from the start, so don't make me look like the bad one." Maledicta muttered coldly and started to leave.

Benedicta's anger seemed to boil over, and she blocked Maledicta's path.

 "You could kill him like you killed Amaya. Have you ever thought about that?" she spat, her eyes blazing with hatred.

Maledicta's face remained calm, but her voice took on a cold tone. "No matter how I think about it, I don't think I killed her. So get out of my way." She said.

Benedicta's smile was like a crack in a mask, revealing the venom beneath. "You will regret this." She said.

And with that, she hit Maledicta hard on the chest. Maledicta gasped, feeling a burning sensation spread from her heart to her entire body.

"What did you do?" Maledicta asked, gripping her chest in pain.

Benedicta's laughter was like a cold wind, 

"It's what you're thinking. You've consumed Red Flame,( A deadly poison made from red-hot volcano lava and Snakes venom)I put it in the drink I gave you yesterday." Benedicta said.

Maledicta's eyes widened in horror as she realized the truth. "You...you poisoned me?"

Benedicta's smile grew wider. "I've been expecting the symptoms to start since morning, but it must be because of your power that you lasted till evening. Maybe if I hadn't hit you, it could have started tomorrow." Benedicta smile.

Maledicta's vision began to blur, and she felt herself falling to the ground. She groaned and grunted as the pain became unbearable, her insides feeling like they were on fire.

Benedicta's laughter echoed through the night air, a cold, mirthless sound.

 "You will regret this." Maledicta groan.

“I won't, you can't even heal yourself” Benedicta said.

As Maledicta lay on the ground, writhing in agony, she saw some student approaching and Benedicta's expression changed. She started faking tears, her voice trembling as she called out for help.

"Please, help my sister!" she yelled, her eyes scanning the surrounding area for any sign of witnesses.

Some students approached, their faces filled with concern.

 "I think she was poisoned with Red Flame," Benedicta said, her voice laced with worry. As they get closer.

The students exchanged nervous glances, their faces paling at the mention of the deadly poison. Red Flame was notorious for its contagious nature; one could fall victim simply by touching the infected.

"Call Mistress Morwen," Benedicta instructed, her eyes fixed on Maledicta's struggling form.

One of the students ran off to fetch the mistress, while the others kept their distance, fearful of contracting the poison.

Kaiden arrived moo immediately, He had heard something was wrong with Maledicta, and he rushed to her side without hesitation. He started running towards her on the ground.

But Benedicta grabbed his arm, holding him back. 

"It's contagious and very dangerous," she warned, her eyes wide with concern.

Kaiden didn't respond, his gaze fixed on Maledicta's struggling form. He tried to shake off Benedicta's grip, but she held tight.

"You're just an ordinary human, you could die immediately you touch her," Benedicta said, her voice trembling with worry.

Kaiden's expression turned cold, his eyes flashing with anger. 

"Do I look like I care? Let me go immediately." He snapped.

Benedicta's grip tightened, her eyes pleading. "Kaiden, my mom is coming, she could find something to do." She said.

"Do you think I can watch my woman in pain without doing anything?" he snapped, his voice cold and deadly.

"Kaiden, I don't want to lose you." Benedicta said gently.

“Let me go” Kaiden said and snatch his arm with force, Benedicta went tumbling to the ground, her mouth packing some sand.

But Kaiden didn't even spare her a glance. He rushed to Maledicta's side, she was already loosing consciousness.
 
Kaiden cradled Maledicta's head in his lap, his voice shaking with worry as he called out her name. "Maledicta, wake up! Please, don't leave me!"

To everyone's surprise, the poison started to move from Maledicta's body to Kaiden's. 

At first, it was just a faint glow, but soon Kaiden's veins began to show, hot and red as the poison coursed through his body. He screamed in pain, his body arching backward as the agony overwhelmed him.

And then, just as suddenly, he went limp, losing consciousness as the poison took hold.

The onlookers gasped in shock, their faces pale with fear. Benedicta's eyes were wide with horror, her mouth hanging open in a silent scream.

Maledicta, however, was stirring, her eyes fluttering open as she took a deep breath. She looked up at Kaiden's unconscious form, her face etched with worry and fear.

"Kaiden!" she whispered, her voice trembling with emotion. "No, please don't leave me!"

But Kaiden didn't respond, his body lying limp and still as the poison continued to course through his veins. Maledicta's eyes filled with tears, her heart breaking at the thought of losing the man she loved.

        (DESPERATE 2)

Maledicta's scream echoed through the night air as she saw Kaiden's lifeless body. She tried to reach out to him, but her body was still weak from the poison. She tried to call out his name again, but her voice was barely a whisper.

And then, everything went black.

Mistress Morwen arrived on the scene, her eyes widening in shock as she took in the sight of Kaiden's unconscious form and Maledicta's limp body.

"Take Maledicta to the physician, she needs to be attended to," Mistress Morwen instructed, her voice firm and authoritative.

The students hesitated, still afraid of the poison that had almost claimed Maledicta's life.

 "The poison has left her body already, as you can see." Mistress said trying to assure them.

Some students quickly stepped forward to carry Maledicta to the physician, leaving Mistress Morwen to attend to Kaiden.

As Mistress Morwen approach Kaiden lifeless body Benedicta grabbed her mother's arm, holding her back. 

"Mum, it's dangerous," she warned.

But Mistress Morwen was resolute.

 "I know, but I can't just watch him die. Maledicta will never forgive herself for it, and I don't want her blaming herself for anything." Mistress Morwen said.

Benedicta rolled her eyes, watching as her mother moved closer to Kaiden's unconscious form.

But just as Mistress Morwen was about to touch Kaiden.

"I think I can heal him."Benedicta spoke up. 

Mistress Morwen turned to face her, surprise etched on her face. 

"What are you talking about?" she asked.

Benedicta's expression was calm, but her eyes betrayed a hint of desperation. 

"Remember, healing is part of my power. I can heal him by moving the poison to my body and then I'll heal myself." She said.

Mistress Morwen's face clouded with worry.

 "What if it doesn't work? It could be very dangerous for you." She said.

But Benedicta wasn't even afraid, she just let out a smile.

 "Don't worry, Mum, I'll do it." She said.

She moved closer to Kaiden, her eyes fixed on his pale face. She was still angry with him for ruining her plan to get rid of Maledicta, but she couldn't let him die. She still loved him, despite everything.

She touched his chest, closed her eyes, and began to mutter some words. The poison started to move from Kaiden's body to hers, and she felt a searing pain coursing through her veins.

But she gritted her teeth, using all her power to resist the pain. She stood up when she was done, her face pale and her body weak.

"He should be taken to the physician too," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Mistress Morwen nodded, her eyes filled with gratitude. "Thank you, Benedicta."

But Benedicta just shook her head, her eyes flashing with anger. "Don't thank me, Mum. I just did it for myself." She wanted to fall and her mother wanted to support her but she quickly move back.

“Touching me is dangerous mum and I told you I am okay” she said And with that, she turned and left, disappearing into the night.

As soon as she reached her room, she went into her wardrobe, her body already starting to feel the effects of the poison. She was groaning in deep pain, her body red and inflamed.

She brought out a bottle and emptied the contents into her mouth. At first, nothing seemed to happen, but then her body suddenly froze, encased in a layer of ice.

When the ice finally melted, Benedicta was okay, her body healed. She lay down on her bed, breathing a sigh of relief.

"Thanks goodness I bought the frozen water," she muttered, a sly smile spreading across her face.

The frozen water was the only medicine that could cure Red Flame poison, the antidote. Benedicta had bought it with the poison, knowing that it might come in handy someday.

She scoffed, her eyes flashing with anger. "Why did my plan keep falling?" she muttered.

But for now, she just closed her eyes, a sly smile still playing on her lips. She knew she wouldn't be backing down soon. There was always room for another plan, another scheme to get rid of Maledicta and claim Kaiden for herself.

And with that thought, Benedicta drifted off to sleep.

         THE NEXT DAY   

Cassius woke up to a pounding headache, the consequences of a night spent drinking. He knew he had broken the rules; alcohol was strictly forbidden except during special occasions. He rubbed his temples, trying to alleviate the pain.

As he stood up, Belladonna entered his room, a look of concern etched on her face.

 "What are you doing here?" Cassius asked gruffly, not bothering to hide his annoyance.

Belladonna held out a small pouch containing a herb. "I saved you last night. You were drunk. This herb will help with your hangover." She said.

Cassius didn't even glance at the herb. Instead, he glared at Belladonna, his eyes cold and unforgiving. 

"So why are you still here? Did you think I'd consider you because she's with another man now?" He asked.

Belladonna's expression remained calm, but her voice took on a hint of anger. 

“What are you talking about?, Cassius." We asked.

"Just like you, I know how to wait. I'll keep waiting until she comes back to me. She'll realize the human boy isn't worth her love, and she'll come crawling back to beg me."Cassius smirked confidently.

Belladonna's eyes flashed with anger. "You're really a jerk, you know that right?" She asked.

"But you can't resist the jerk."Cassius chuckled, his smile condescending.

Belladonna's face twisted in disgust. "Who says I can't? You know what? I'm finally done with all this. Done waiting for you for more than three years. I'm so done, and I mean it." She snapped.

Cassius raised an eyebrow, his smirk faltering for a moment. "What are you talking about?" He asked.

"I, Belladonna Edward, accept your rejection and will no longer be your mate." Belladonna said coldy while glaring at him.

Cassius's laughter was mocking, dismissive. "You're kidding, right?" He asked.

"I'll never joke about something like that. I hope you're happy now. You finally have the freedom you've always wished for and also good luck in getting the girl." She said and with that, she turned and stormed out of the room, leaving Cassius looking taken aback.

"She's joking. She'll soon come back and start begging me."He muttered to himself.

Cassius's gaze fell on the herb Belladonna had left behind. He picked it up, drinking the contents in one swift motion.

Meanwhile, Belladonna bumped into Thane in the corridor. He caught her by the arms, steadying her.

"You should be careful," Thane said gently, his eyes scanning her face.

But his expression changed to one of concern when he saw the tears streaming down her face.

"Are you okay?" he asked worriedly, his voice soft and gentle.

Belladonna nodded, trying to clean her tears. "I'm fine." She said.

Thane's eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched in anger.

 "Is it my brother again?" He asked.

Belladonna shook her head, trying to compose herself. 

"I just want to be alone. We'll talk later." She said.

Thane's expression softened, and he nodded. "Okay, but if you need someone to talk to, I'm here."

Belladonna forced a smile and nodded before turning and running off.

Thane called after her, "Belladonna!" but she was already gone.

Belladonna reached her room, slamming the door shut behind her. She lay on her bed, her tears flowing freely, but she was determined that these would be her last tears. She would never cry because of Cassius again.
.

.
.
Maledicta shook a little, slowly regaining consciousness. She opened her eyes, confusion etched on her face as she stared at the unfamiliar room. But as memories of the previous night flooded back, she sat up with a start.

The older physician, who had been sitting beside her bed, placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. 

"You have to rest, your body is still weak." She said.

Maledicta shook off the physician's hand, her eyes scanning the room frantically.

 "Where is Kaiden?" she asked, her voice trembling with worry.

 "He's okay, he needs rest too." The older lady said.

"Take me to him." Maledicta said.

The physician sighed, nodding reluctantly. "Very well, but please, don't exert yourself too much." She said.

Maledicta didn't respond, already throwing off the covers and swinging her legs over the side of the bed. The physician helped her up, supporting her as she walked to Kaiden's room.

As they entered the room, Maledicta's eyes locked onto Kaiden's pale face. She rushed to his side, grabbing his hand in hers. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she took in his weak, fragile appearance.

"It's my fault," she whispered, her voice cracking with emotion. "I should have stayed away from him."

Before she knew it, tears started falling from her eyes, dropping onto Kaiden's face. He stirred, his eyes fluttering open as he smiled weakly at Maledicta.

"I'm glad you're safe," he said gently, his voice barely above a whisper.

Maledicta's tears fell harder, her body shaking with sobs. 

"How can you still care about me when I put you in trouble?" she snapped, her voice laced with guilt and regret.

Kaiden's smile never wavered. "I told you I'd protect you, so stop crying. This isn't like you." He said.

He gently wiped away her tears, his touch sending shivers down her spine. But Maledicta couldn't stop crying, overcome with emotion as she stared at Kaiden's pale face.

Kaiden pulled her closer, hugging her tightly as she sobbed into his chest. Ryder, who had been about to enter the room, stopped in his tracks, a small smile on his face as he watched the tender moment between Kaiden and Maledicta. He nodded to himself, backing away quietly.

Mistress Morwen entered the room a few minutes later, a look of relief washing over her face as she saw Kaiden and Maledicta sitting up, holding each other.

"What happened?"How did you manage to consume Red Flame?" She asked Maledicta after some minutes.

"I don't know."Maledicta shrugged

Mistress Morwen's eyes narrowed. "How is that possible? Have you eaten anything strange lately?" She asked.

Maledicta shook her head. "I ate nothing strange. Who knows, it could be part of my punishment for being cursed." She said.

"I forbid it. You don't know how worried I was when I thought you both were going to die. Kaiden, I know you don't have any family in this world, I am ready to be your mom. Just come to me for anything." She said while looking at Kaiden.

Kaiden's face lit up with a warm smile. "Thank you...Mom." He stammered.

Mistress Morwen's eyes sparkled with tears as she patted Kaiden's back.

 "I'm glad you're both safe. Now, get some rest." She said.

As Mistress Morwen left the room, Maledicta rolled her eyes. 

"Don't mind her, she's so dramatic." She said.

Kaiden chuckled, pushing Maledicta gently into the bed. "No, I think I like her." He said.

Maledicta smile as Kaiden snuggled beside her, wrapping his arms around her. 

"We should spend today together." She said.

"I like that." Kaiden  said.

He pecked her lips gently, sending shivers down her spine. Maledicta's heart swelled with love and gratitude, knowing that Kaiden was safe, and that they had each other.
.

.

Arachne jogged into the library, a bright smile plastered on her face. She spotted Ryder sitting at a table and hurried over to join him.

"Hey, why are you so happy?" Ryder asked, raising an eyebrow as he took in Arachne's radiant grin.

Arachne plopped down beside him, barely containing her excitement. 

"I received a letter from my parents yesterday, and they told me we'll soon visit the palace. I'll finally get to see the prince!" she squealed, her eyes shining with anticipation.

Ryder raised an eyebrow, "Why are you so happy about that? What if he's not as you expected? What if he didn't like you because he has another girl? What if he's someone you least expected?" he asked.

Arachne's grin faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. 

"I haven't thought of those," she admitted, her smile returning.

Ryder shook his head, a wry smile twisting his lips. 

"You're really pathetic." He said.

Arachne playfully rolled her eyes. "Stop being jealous of my prince." She said.

Ryder scoffed, standing up to leave. "I'm not jealous." He muttered.

"You're just mad because you don't have a chance to see the prince!"Arachne yelled after him.

Ryder chuckled, shaking his head as he walked out of the library.

Just outside the door, he ran into Aka, who approached him with a smile.

 "I hope you haven't forgotten about our plan?" she asked.

Ryder smiled, feeling a flutter in his chest. "I haven't." He said.

Aka's smile grew wider. "I'll really be thankful if I can get that book. I really like Maledicta." She said.

As Aka touched his cheek, Ryder felt a shiver run down his spine. He smiled nervously, trying to play it cool.

"See you," Aka muttered, before turning and walking away.

Ryder watched her go, a smile still plastered on his face.

 "So that was your crush."Arachne voice suddenly said behind him.

Ryder turned to face her, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks.

 "What are you talking about?" he asked, trying to feign nonchalance.

Arachne grinned mischievously. "I can see the way you always act around her. She's pretty though" she whisper.

"You're just trying to get under my skin."Ryder shook his head, chuckling.

Arachne laughed, skipping away. "Maybe I am, maybe I'm not." She said.

Ryder watched her go, a wry smile twisting his lips.

Maledicta woke up beside Kaiden, feeling a sense of surprise and wonder. Her body was healed, the pain and weakness from the previous day's events completely gone. It was as if spending time with Kaiden had somehow healed her, body and soul.

But as she sat up, she realized that Kaiden was nowhere to be found. She looked around, confused, and that was when she saw the note on the bedside table. "Had to take care of something. Will be back soon. -Kaiden"

 She also had more pressing matters to attend to.

Like Benedicta.

Maledicta disappeared from the room, reappearing in front of Benedicta, who was sitting under a tree in the forest. Benedicta's eyes widened in surprise as she saw Maledicta, and she tried to scramble to her feet, but Maledicta was too quick.

Maledicta caught Benedicta's arm and threw her against the tree trunk. Benedicta groaned, stumbling to the ground, but she quickly scrambled to her feet, her eyes blazing with anger.

"You think you can just attack me?" Benedicta spat, her hand reaching into her pocket for a knife.

But Maledicta was ready for her. She caught Benedicta's fist and twisted her hand, making Benedicta cry out in pain.

"You know, I've been trying to tolerate you because of our mum," Maledicta said, her voice cold and detached.

 "I didn't want her to know the type of person you are. I didn't want her to be sad. But I don't think I can do that anymore." She added.

Benedicta's face twisted with rage. "Shut up, bastard!" she yelled, trying to stab Maledicta in the heart.

But Maledicta was too quick. She caught the knife and slapped Benedicta hard across the face, making her stumble backward. Benedicta's nose started bleeding immediately, and she glared at Maledicta with pure hatred.

"This should be the last time you find trouble with me," Maledicta warned, her eyes flashing with anger. 

"Or else everyone will know who you truly are." She said.

With that, Maledicta turned and walked away, leaving Benedicta seething with anger and humiliation. Benedicta remained on the ground, her eyes blazing with fury as she wiped the blood from her nose.
.
.
.

Benedicta was going to her room, she had healed herself and was just returning from the forest. She suddenly saw Kaiden. 

"Are you okay?" He asked worriedly.

 "Yeah" she muttered. 

"I hear you saved me, thank you so much" Kaiden said. 

"It's nothing, I couldn't watch when you are in pain, we are friends remember" she said with a smile.

"You are the greatest friend ever" Kaiden said.

Benedicta suddenly saw Maledicta approaching, and smiled to herself,  She suddenly clutched her stomach and fell to the ground. 

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked worriedly.

"I am not, I think the poison is still affecting me a little" she said with a fake cry.

Kaiden was about to touch her when he heard another cry behind him. He turned and was shocked to see Maledicta on the ground too.

"Kaiden, my hand and leg hurt" Maledicta cried with a cute pout.

Without thinking twice, Kaiden rushed to her side, ignoring Benedicta, who was still on the ground.

"Where is it hurting you?" Kaiden asked worriedly while checking her body.

"It hurts all over, I think I need perfect rest, take me to your room" Maledicta said.

Kaiden scooped her up in a bridal style and she immediately wrap her arm around his neck.

Maledicta smirked at Benedicta, who was still on the ground, as Kaiden took her away.

            (I LOVE YOU)

Benedicta watched as Kaiden carried Maledicta away, her anger boiling over like a pot left unattended on the stove. She couldn't even move from the ground, she just sat there, frozen in rage.

A male student approached her, concern etched on his face.

 "Do you need some help, senior?" he asked, offering his hand with a smile.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger, but she quickly composed herself, forcing a weak smile onto her face.

 "Thank you," she said, accepting his arm.

As the student helped her up, Benedicta secretly seethed with anger. She couldn't believe Kaiden had fallen for Maledicta's tricks so easily. Didn't he see that Maledicta was just using him?

With the student's help, Benedicta stormed toward her room, her feet pounding the ground in anger. As she walked, she saw Aka slipping into the bush, and she scoffed.

"She's been so useless," Benedicta muttered to herself.

 "Just enjoying herself and not focusing on the main reason she was sent here." She added.

But as Benedicta approached her room, a bright smile suddenly spread across her face. She had an idea.

Epusa was very powerful, and Benedicta knew that if she could just find the Lucan they were looking for, the Queen would grant her any wish she desired. And Benedicta knew exactly what she would wish for.

"I will just take matters into my own hands then," Benedicta muttered to herself, a sly smile spreading across her face.

She knew it would be easy to spot him If he is a student her. She would find the Lucan, no matter what it took. And when she did, she would make sure that Maledicta paid for what she had done.

Benedicta's mood wasn't down anymore. She felt a sense of purpose,All she needed to find was the so-called Lucan, and she would get everything she had ever wished for. Including Kaiden.

As she entered her room, Benedicta's eyes scanned the space,Her eyes scanning the papers and books scattered across the surface. She would start her search now, and she wouldn't rest until she found what she was looking for.

The Lucan.
.
.
.
Kaiden arrived in his room, still looking worry-sick. He was really afraid, what if the poison was still affecting Maledicta? He gently dropped her on the bed and held her face in his palm.

"Is it hurting so much?" he asked, his voice laced with concern.

Maledicta smiled weakly and shook her head. "No, I'm okay. I'll just sleep." She said.

Kaiden's eyes scanned her face, searching for any signs of distress. He seemed satisfied with what he saw and nodded. 

"Okay, have a good rest. I need to visit Benedicta, she wasn't looking so good." He said.

Maledicta's eyes flickered with annoyance, but she quickly masked it with a sleepy expression. "Okay."

As Kaiden stood up and turned to leave, Maledicta suddenly screamed, making him rush back to her side.

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice laced with worry.

Maledicta's face scrunched up in a cute pout.

 "I don't know, I just don't feel comfortable." She said.

Kaiden's eyes narrowed, unsure of what to do. "Should I take you to the physician?" he asked.

Maledicta shook her head, her pout deepening. "No, let's just sleep, okay?”She said and push him beside her.

Kaiden hesitated, thinking that what was bothering her must be serious. But Maledicta's expression was so pitiful that he couldn't resist.

"Okay," he said finally, lying beside her on the bed.

Maledicta smiled in satisfaction, snuggling closer to Kaiden. She had never thought she would act petty before, but she just couldn't help it. The memory of Benedicta's expression when Kaiden ignored her and rushed to Maledicta's side was just too satisfying.

She chuckled to herself, feeling a little guilty for being so mean. But she quickly pushed the guilt aside, focusing on the warmth of Kaiden's body beside hers.

 She was enjoying the attention too much. Kaiden body wasn't that relax because he is still worry about her.

"Stop worrying," she said, snuggling closer to Kaiden.

 "You're my pill, right? Let's just sleep. If I feel the pain come again, we can go to the physician then." She added.

Kaiden's arm tightened around her, holding her close. "Okay," he whispered. "Sleep tight."

Maledicta smiled, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. She kissed Kaiden's cheek, and soon they both drifted off to sleep.

As they slept,the darkness of the room was filled with the sound of their gentle breathing, a soothing melody that seemed to lull the world into a peaceful slumber. But beneath the surface.

The students were rushing to the training ground, eager to begin their daily training session. Cassius, standing by the door, watched them with boredom. His eyes, however, lit up with anticipation when he saw Belladonna approaching.

He had a smirk on his face, expecting her to beg him for attention or training tips. But to his surprise, she walked past him without saying a word, not even sparing him a glance. Cassius's smirk disappeared, replaced by shock and confusion.

He stood in the same spot for several minutes, trying to process what had just happened. Belladonna had never ignored him before. In fact, she had always been the one trying to get his attention, and he had always been the one ignoring her.

Cassius shook his head, trying to clear the cobwebs. He couldn't believe he was actually feeling sad about being ignored by Belladonna. He had always wanted her to leave him alone, and now that she was, he felt...off.

He took a deep breath and walked into the training room, trying to shake off the strange feeling. The room was bustling with students, all eager to begin their training. Cassius spotted Belladonna on the other side of the room, already training a group of students.

He watched her for a moment, mesmerized by her fluid movements and effortless magic. She was a natural, and he had to admit, he was impressed.

Cassius turned away, trying to focus on his own students. But he couldn't help sneaking glances at Belladonna, who was now flying through the air with ease, her students watching in awe. 

"What's funny?" someone asked, breaking Cassius's concentration.

He turned to see Thane standing beside him, a raised eyebrow on his face.

"What are you talking about?" Cassius muttered, trying to play it cool.

"I saw you grinning," Thane said. "You were staring at Belladonna. What's so funny?"

Cassius's face grew hot with embarrassment. "You must have seen wrong," he denied, trying to brush it off.

Thane shrugged and walked away, leaving Cassius feeling flustered and annoyed.

Cassius tried everything in his power to resist looking at Belladonna, but he couldn't help himself. He sneaked glances at her throughout the training session, watching as she laughed and joked with her students.

By the time the session was over, Cassius was surprised to see Belladonna laughing hard with Thane. He felt a pang of...something...he couldn't quite explain.

"When did he get close to her?" Cassius muttered to himself, feeling a twinge of annoyance.

Thane whispered something in Belladonna's ear, and she laughed again, her eyes sparkling with amusement. Cassius's eyes narrowed, feeling a surge of...possessiveness?

"What's so funny?" he scoffed, trying to sound nonchalant.

Just then, Thane reached out to touch Belladonna's hair, and Cassius reacted without thinking. He sped across the room, grabbing Thane's hand before he could reach Belladonna's hair.

The two of them looked at him in confusion, Belladonna's laughter dying on her lips.

"Why did you want to touch her hair?" Cassius asked, his voice sounding strange even to his own ears.

Thane looked at him like he was crazy. "She has a leaf in her hair." He said.

Belladonna's eyes widened, and she reached up to touch her hair. "That must be when I went to the lake." She said.

Cassius's eyes locked onto the leaf, and without thinking, he reached out and gently removed it from Belladonna's hair. Their eyes met, and for a moment, they just stared at each other.

Thane cleared his throat, breaking the spell. "Uh, thanks, Cassius."

Cassius's face grew hot with embarrassment. "Thane, I have something important to tell you."

Thane raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"

Cassius hesitated, realizing he didn't actually have anything to say. "Uh, never mind. Just...just go train your students or something."

Thane looked at him like he was crazy, but he shrugged and walked away.

As soon as Thane was out of earshot, Cassius turned to Belladonna. "You...uh...you should be careful. Thane can be...persistent."

Belladonna looked at him, "I can take care of myself, Cassius." She said and walk away from him.

Cassius's face grew hot with embarrassment.

 "Right. Of course. Sorry." He yelled after her.

He turned and walked away, feeling like a complete idiot.

As he walked out of the training room, he heard Thane's voice behind him. 

"What did you want to tell me before?" He asked.

“Just go to your room and stop distracting her” Cassius said.

    “Distracting who?” Thane asked Cassius didn't respond and just left.

    “The fool is finally coming to his senses” Thane said while chuckling.

The sun had just begun to set, casting a warm orange glow over the forest. The students of the academy were milling about, enjoying the freedom of the evening after a long day of classes. Thane, however, had other plans. He had been drawn to the abandoned side of the forest, a place where few students dared to venture.

The rumors of demons and evil creatures lurking in the shadows had kept most students away, but Thane was not one to believe in rumors. He had been coming to this side of the forest for weeks now, and he had yet to encounter anything out of the ordinary.

As he walked towards the waterfall, the sound of rushing water grew louder, and he felt a sense of peace wash over him. He had always found solace in the natural beauty of the forest, and this spot was one of his favorites.

But as he approached the waterfall, he noticed something that made his heart skip a beat. There was someone swimming in the water. Thane's eyes narrowed as he tried to get a better look. The person was a girl, and she seemed to be alone.

Thane's curiosity got the better of him, and he crept closer, trying not to make a sound. The girl looked up, and their eyes met. Thane felt a jolt of surprise, and the girl's eyes widened in shock.

"What are you doing here?" Lilith asked, her voice trembling slightly.

Thane shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. "I should be the one asking. I've been coming here alone for like a month." He said.

Lilith's eyes flashed with anger. "Me too, so this belongs to me." She said.

Thane chuckled, a low, husky sound. "If you think I'll leave, then you're really wrong." He muttered.

Lilith's eyes narrowed, and Thane could see the challenge in her eyes. He smiled, enjoying the spark of tension between them. Without another word, he started taking off his clothes, his movements deliberate and slow.

Lilith's eyes widened in shock, and she looked away, her cheeks flushing.

 "What are you doing?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane grinned, enjoying her discomfort. "I want to swim, or what does it look like?" He asked.

He approached the water's edge, his eyes locked on Lilith's. She looked up, her eyes meeting his, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. 

Lilith was the first to break the silence. "I'm naked," she said, her voice trembling. 

"I had no idea you'd show up." She  added.

Thane shrugged, "Did I look like I care?"

He entered the water, his movements smooth and confident. Lilith watched him, her eyes fixed on his chest and abs. Thane could sense her gaze, and he felt a surge of pride.

As he approached her, Lilith quickly covered herself, her eyes flashing with embarrassment.

 "Don't come near me," she warned, her voice firm.

Thane chuckled, enjoying the drama. "I can't even see your nakedness, so stop being dramatic." He said.

Lilith glared at him, but eventually, she released her hand, and Thane caught a glimpse of her naked body. He felt a jolt of desire, but he quickly pushed it aside.

For a few moments, they just swam in silence, the only sound the rushing water. Thane watched Lilith, admiring her beauty and her confidence.

But then, Lilith suddenly screamed, her body thrashing about in the water. 

"There's something in the water!" she exclaimed, her voice panicked.

Thane rushed to her side, his heart racing with concern.

 "What is it?" he asked, his eyes scanning the water.

But before he could see anything, Lilith had already swum towards him and jumped into his arms. Thane caught her, feeling her soft body against his. For a moment, they just stared at each other, their eyes locked in a charged moment.

Then, Lilith seemed to realize her mistake, and she quickly jumped off, her face flushing with embarrassment. 

"I didn't mean to..." she stammered.

Thane chuckled, enjoying her discomfort. "It's just funny. You were saying I was a pervert earlier, but here you are, gluing your naked self to my body." He said.

Lilith's face turned bright red, and she quickly looked away. 

"I don't know why we always end up in the same place, no matter how we try not to." She scoffed.

“Yes, we always does every time” he said seriously.

As they stood there, the tension between them grew thicker, until Thane finally broke the silence. "Keep wondering, too."

He slowly moved closer to her and she didn't bother to move away, his hand cup her cheeks and he started leaning in, she close her eyes and their lip touch, they kiss deeply for a while until he finally broke it. Lilith suddenly gasp.

    “We shouldn't have do that” she said and started running off.

    “Lilith” he called after her 
but she didn't answer and just run away after wearing her clothes. Thane remain in the water while watching him go.
.

.

Ryder burst into Kaiden's room, a look of excitement on his face. But his expression quickly changed to one of surprise as he took in Kaiden's partially dressed state.

Kaiden was standing in front of his dresser, his shirt slung over his shoulder, ready to be put on. Ryder's eyes widened as he took in the sight of Kaiden's bare back.

"Wait, what is this mark on your back?" Ryder asked, his voice full of surprise.

Kaiden shrugged, seemingly unconcerned. "I don't know, it's been there since I was born." He said.

Ryder's eyes were fixed on the mark, "Wow, it looks strange. I feel weird about it too." He said.

Kaiden chuckled,  "It's nothing serious. But it does itch sometimes. And I could swear it shone once, but I'm sure that was just my imagination." He shrugged.

 "What if it's not just your imagination? What if it's something more?" Ryder asked while touching the mark.

Kaiden raised an eyebrow,"What are you talking about?" He asked.

 "I'm talking about the possibility that you're not human. That mark could be a sign of something more." Ryder said.

"You should show Mistress Morwen," Ryder said, his voice full of conviction. "She's been around for centuries. If anyone knows what that mark means, it's her." He added.

Kaiden nodded, seemingly considering Ryder's words.

"Why are you here, anyway?" Kaiden asked, changing the subject.

"I'm off to the palace. I'll be back tomorrow night." Ryder said coldly

"How do you feel about getting married?" He asked.

Ryder's expression turned serious, and he shrugged. "I don't know what to say. Let's just get there first.” He said.

Kaiden chuckled and clapped Ryder on the back. "Okay, can't wait for you to come back." He said.

Ryder grinned and waved as he left the room. Kaiden watched him go, a thoughtful expression on his face.

As the door closed behind Ryder, Kaiden turned his attention back to the mark on his back. He couldn't shake off the feeling that Ryder's words had stirred up inside him.

What if he wasn't human? What if that mark meant something more?, he turn his back towards the mirror and stare at the mark once before wearing his clothes, he couldn't stay with Maledicta tonight since Belladonna is hanging out with her.
.
.
.
.

Maledicta's heart skipped a beat as she heard the knock on the door. She was expecting Belladonna, but as she opened the door, her eyes widened in horror. Instead of her friend, she saw a letter filled with blood on the ground.

She picked it up with shaking hands, her heart racing with anticipation. As she opened the letter, her eyes scanned the words, and her blood ran cold.

"Since you can't give him to me, then none of us can have him. You should visit the forest. I have something special for you there."

Maledicta's eyes widened in terror as she realized who must have written the letter. Benedicta. She felt a chill run down her spine as she dropped the paper, her hands shaking uncontrollably.

Without hesitation, she vanished into Kaiden's room, but he wasn't there. Panic set in as she quickly went into the forest, calling out his name. But there was no response.

As she walked deeper into the forest, her heart pounding in her chest, she stumbled upon something wet. She looked down to see a pool of blood, and her heart skipped a beat.

She moved back fearfully, her eyes scanning the surrounding area. And then, she saw it. Kaiden's hand was nailed to a tree, his body hanging limply. Maledicta's scream was blood-curdling as she stumbled backward, her eyes fixed on Kaiden's lifeless body.

"No, no, no!" she cried, her voice echoing through the forest. "Kaiden, please!"

But as she looked closer, everything suddenly vanished, and she was left standing alone in the forest. She heard a laughter behind her, and she spun around, her eyes scanning the area.

"How does that feel?" Benedicta's voice echoed through the forest, but Maledicta couldn't see her.

Maledicta's anger boiled over.

"This could be real if you didn't stay away from him” Benedicta added.

“Remain hiding, don't ever show yourself, because I will kill you for real." Maledicta said angril and Maledicta vanished, reappearing in front of her room. She saw Kaiden pacing around, looking worried.

"I'm sorry for coming," he started to say, but Maledicta cut him off, hugging him tightly.

"Don't ever stay away from me again," she whispered, her voice breathless. 

"I love you so much." She added seriously, her eyes still filled with fear of loosing him.

                 (MY MAN)

Ryder stepped out of his room, adjusting his dress as he made his way to the sitting room. He had been invited to breakfast, and strangely, he wanted to make a good impression. He arrive very late last night and just went to bed since he was really tired.

As he approached the palace dinning room, he could hear the murmur of voices and the clinking of silverware. He took a deep breath, smoothing out his expression before entering the room.

The room fell silent as he entered, and Ryder's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of his parents, the king and queen, and a couple he didn't recognize. They looked familiar, but he couldn't quite place them.

"Ah, Ryder, good morning," his mother said, smiling brightly. "We're so glad you could join us."

Ryder smiled back, taking a seat at the table. "Good morning, Mother. Father."

His parents exchanged a warm smile, and the king spoke up. "Ryder, I believe you've met Arachne's parents before?" He asked.

Ryder's eyes flicked to the couple, and he nodded politely. "I think so. Though I'm not quite sure." He muttered.

Arachne's mother smiled warmly. "We've heard so much about you, Ryder. Our daughter has been looking forward to meeting you." She said.

Ryder's eyes scanned the room, searching for Arachne. But she was nowhere to be found.

"I hear you are also in Nightshade Wonderland, You must have met her once." Arachne's father said.

Ryder's expression turned thoughtful, but before he could respond, a commotion at the door caught his attention.

A group of maids entered the room, leading a young woman who looked like a vision in a beautiful gown. Ryder's eyes widened as he took in her beauty, but his expression quickly turned stoic.

"Meet your future wife, Ryder," his mother said, beaming with pride. "I'm sure you'll love her."

Ryder didn't respond, his eyes fixed on the Arachne, who has a nervous smile on her face.

Arachne's eyes were fixed on the floor, her face pale. But as she looked up, her eyes met Ryder's, and her expression changed from nervousness to shock.

"You......" she started to say, her voice trailing off.

Ryder's expression remained neutral, but his eyes seemed to bore into Arachne's soul.

"Do you know each other?" the king asked, his voice curious.

"No, I don't know her."Ryder spoke up quickly, his voice firm.

Arachne's eyes flashed with surprise, and she looked like she was about to say something. But Ryder's expression silenced her, and she looked away, her face pale.

The king smiled, seemingly oblivious to the tension. 

"Well, you can get to know each other now. You can have your privacy." He said.

Ryder stood up, his eyes fixed on Arachne. "Follow me." He muttered.

He turned and walked away, leaving Arachne to follow him. She looked back at her parents, who gave her an encouraging smile. She bow to the king and queen.

As they left the room, the king turned to Arachne's parents. 

"She's so respectful. I like her so much." He said.

Arachne's father smiled, his eyes warm with pride. "She's the best. Since we lost her sister, she hasn't made us feel bad." He said.

The king nodded,  "I'm sure Ryder will be lucky to have such a lady as a wife." He said.

 "No, our daughter is the luckiest." Arachne's mother said.

The room fell silent, and the king smiled, "Well, I suppose we'll just have to wait and see." He said.
.
.
.

Arachne followed Ryder, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't believe what she had just discovered. Ryder is the prince, he had been watching her all along, and she had no idea.

As they entered his room, Ryder closed the door behind them, She had never been alone with him before, and she wasn't sure what to expect but she isn't ready to act like a coward.

"I must have looked like a fool to you, right?" Arachne said, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"So, you're the prince, but you watch me make a fool of myself always." She added.

Ryder's expression was neutral, but Arachne could sense a hint of amusement in his eyes. "Arachne, I don't expose myself. You didn't expect me to tell you, did you?" He asked.

Arachne felt a pang of hurt. "Why did you deny knowing me?" she asked again.

Ryder shrugged. "I asked my reasons. They would have bombarded us with questions. You should understand that." He said.

Arachne's eyes narrowed. "That hurt," she said, her voice soft.

 "I warned you about all this. You're just so slow-witted." Ryder scoffed.

Arachne's eyes flashed with anger. "That's not my fault, okay?" she snapped back.

 "Just go out and pretend like this is nothing. We'll talk in school." Ryder said.

But Arachne wasn't having it. "You don't like me, right? You're not happy about the marriage, right? You like that girl, Aka, right?" she asked, her voice rapid-fire.

Ryder's eyes narrowed. "You ask too many questions." He muttered.

 "Then give me answers. Let me know where I stand. I can't drag you into something you don't want." She said seriously, Ryder have never seen her act this serious before.

"I can't give you the answers you want." He said,his words were like a slap in the face.

Arachne felt a pang of hurt, and she knew she had to get out of there before she broke down. 

"Okay, then. I get it. I'll just leave." She said.

She turned and walked out of the room,  "Arachne!" Ryder call after her.

But she didn't stop. She kept walking until she reached the sitting room, where their parents were waiting.

"Have you finished your talk? That was quick," the queen said.

"Mum, can I go back to School now?" Arachne asked, trying to keep her emotions in check.

Her father's expression turned concerned. "What's wrong, darling?" He asked.

Arachne shrugged. "Nothing. I think we're done with the reason we're here." She said.

Her father nodded. "Then I'll prepare the palanquin." He said.

Ryder appeared beside her, his eyes locked on hers.

 "I'll go with her." He said.

"Please don't." Arachne said and left.

 "Don't worry about us," Ryder said to their parents, when he saw the way they are looking at him, he quickly follow Arachne out of the room.

As they reached the palanquin, Arachne quickly got in, trying to put as much distance between herself and Ryder as possible. But Ryder was hot on her heels, forcing himself into the palanquin beside her.

Arachne turned her back on him, trying to ignore the feeling of his eyes on her. Ryder chuckled, the sound sending shivers down her spine.

The sun had just begun to rise, casting a warm glow over the academy. The students were already making their way to the training grounds, eager to begin their morning training. Cassius, however, was lingering by the door, his eyes scanning the crowd for one person in particular.

As he spotted Belladonna walking towards him, a smile spread across his face. But, as was becoming increasingly usual, she ignored him and tried to walk past. Cassius's smile faltered, and he reached out, grabbing her hand and pulling her away from the crowd.

"What do you want?" Belladonna asked, her voice cold and detached, as she tried to release her hand from his grip.

Cassius felt a pang of hurt at her gesture, but he pushed on.

"Why are you acting so strangely around me?" he asked, his eyes searching hers for any sign of the Belladonna he once knew.

Belladonna raised an eyebrow, her expression unyielding.

 "Isn't that what you always wanted?" she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Cassius felt a twinge of guilt at her words. He had, after all, rejected her and pushed her away. But that was before he realized he couldn't stop thinking about her and like the time she was giving him her attention.

He kept quiet, unsure of how to respond. Belladonna, taking his silence as a sign of acceptance, turned to leave. But Cassius wasn't ready to let her go just yet. He grabbed her hand again, holding her in place.

"So, are you into Thane now?" he asked, his voice low and husky. 

"Remember, he's a wolf like me. He could find his mate at any moment." He added.

Belladonna's eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her tone neutral. "That's my problem." She muttered.

Cassius's eyes narrowed, his grip on her hand tightening. 

"You're not allowed to be with any other man," he growled, his voice low and possessive. "You belong to me. We mated, remember?"

 "You rejected me, and I accepted. Remember? So, the bond is no longer there. Stop being greedy and let me go." Belladonna said icily.

Cassius felt a pang of pain at her words. He knew he had hurt her, and now she was pushing him away. But he couldn't help himself. He was drawn to her, and he couldn't let her go.

"I can't," he whispered, his eyes pleading with hers. He cupped her cheeks, his thumbs tracing the contours of her face.

Belladonna struggled against his grip, but Cassius held firm. He leaned in, his lips brushing against hers in a fierce, possessive kiss. Belladonna's eyes widened in shock, and she tried to push him away, but Cassius held her in place.

It wasn't until he broke the kiss that Belladonna's tears began to fall. Cassius's eyes widened in horror as he realized what he had done. He had hurt her again, and this time, it was worse.

"Bella, I'm so sorry," he whispered, his voice shaking with regret. He gently wiped away her tears, his eyes pleading with hers for forgiveness.

But Belladonna just shook her head, her eyes filled with a deep sadness. "Why can't you just let me be?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"Did you enjoy hurting me?" She added.

Cassius felt his heart shatter into a million pieces as he looked at Belladonna's tear-stained face. He knew he had hurt her, and he didn't know how to make it right.

"I'm sorry, Bella,I don't know what came over me. I just...I act without thinking sometimes, Cass was is at me too, he refused to talk to me since the day you accepted my rejection" he said gently.

Belladonna's eyes filled with tears again, and Cassius knew he had to let her go. He released his grip on her hand, and she quickly turned and ran away, leaving Cassius standing alone, feeling like the biggest fool in the world.

"I'm so stupid," he muttered to himself, his eyes fixed on the spot where Belladonna had disappeared. 

"Now I've hurt her again.” he said sadly.

Lilith stepped into the senior section of the library, the soft glow of the lanterns casting a warm light over the rows of ancient tomes. She had been looking forward to a quiet evening alone, hoping to clear her head and shake off the lingering thoughts of Thane.

But as she turned a corner, her heart skipped a beat. Thane was already there, sitting at a table with a book open in front of him. Lilith's first instinct was to turn and run, but Thane was too quick. He looked up, his eyes locking onto hers, and he was out of his seat in an instant.

Before Lilith could react, Thane had grabbed her hand, his fingers wrapping around her wrist like a vice. 

"Are you planning to start avoiding me because of what happened?" he asked, his voice low and husky.

Lilith's face grew hot as she tried to pull her hand free.

 "I should do that," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"It shouldn't have happened, Thane. You'll find your mate soon, and I'll be left heartbroken." She added gently.

Thane's eyes narrowed, his grip on her hand tightening. "Is that what you're worried about?" he asked, his voice gentle.

Lilith nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat. "Not only that, Thane. We shouldn't let things get out of hand." She said.

Thane's expression turned thoughtful, and he released her hand. 

"You don't have to avoid me because of what happened, Let's just forget it never happened if that's what will make you happy." He said.

Lilith's eyes widened in surprise. She hadn't expected Thane to accept easily. 

"You...okay then," she stammered.

Thane nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "I'm off, then. Have fun here alone." He said.

He turned and walked away, leaving Lilith feeling confused and a little hurt. She watched him go, her eyes fixed on his retreating back with mixed emotions.

"How could she regret our kiss?" Thane scoffed angrily to himself as he walked away. He couldn't understand why Lilith would regret something that had felt so right.

He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. He knew he had to respect Lilith's boundaries, but it was hard when all he wanted to do was pull her into his arms and kiss her again.

The Palanquin finally arrive in school and Arachne came out immediately.

"Won't you at least say something?" Ryder asked Arachne as they stepped out of the palanquin.

 "I have nothing to say to you," Arachne said, her voice cold and detached. With that, she stormed off, leaving Ryder standing alone.

Ryder let out a deep sigh, his shoulders sagging in frustration. He shook his head, muttering to himself before heading towards his room.

Arachne, on the other hand, was still walking, her feet carrying to her room.

As she turned a corner, she suddenly heard her name being called. She stopped in her tracks, turning to face the speaker. Her eyes widened in surprise as she took in the sight of Maledicta standing before her.

"You know me and my name too?" Arachne asked, her voice tinged with curiosity.

 "Of course, you're Amaya's sister, right?" Maledicta asked.

"I thought you hated me," Arachne said, her voice soft. "You always ignore me when I try to be friendly. You don't know how happy this makes me." She added.

 "I decided to ignore you since I thought you might be approaching me for a purpose," she explained. 

"Don't you also believe that I killed your sister?" Maledicta asked.

 "I know you didn't, Before her death, she told me someone had been following her for a while. I know you were framed." Arachne said.

Maledicta's eyes widened in surprise, "Thank you for believing me,I promise to catch her killer and make them regret coming to this world," Maledicta said, her voice steady.

 "Thank you so much," Arachne whispered, her voice cracking.

Without warning, Arachne threw her arms around Maledicta, hugging her tightly. Maledicta was taken aback by the sudden display of affection, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she wrapped her arms around Arachne, holding her close.

"I was in a bad mood, but you made me really happy," Arachne said, her voice muffled against Maledicta's shoulder. 

"Can I call you sister? Amaya told me a lot about you. I know you're a really nice person. That's why I couldn't stop getting closer." She asked.

 "Be careful," Maledicta whispered, her voice gentle.

Arachne pulled back, a grin spreading across her face.

 "I will. Goodnight, sis," she said.

Maledicta watched as Arachne walked away, a smile slowly spreading across her face. She knew she was really changing, and it was all thanks to the people around her.

Benedicta's eyes gleamed with excitement as she muttered the words of the love spell under her breath. She had been practicing this spell for weeks, and she was confident that it would finally give her the upper hand with Kaiden.

She closed the book, and it disappeared into thin air. A book like that was far too dangerous to be found in her possession. It contained black magic, the kind that could get her killed if discovered.

But Benedicta was willing to take that risk. She had been using the book's spells to manipulate those around her, and so far, it had been working beautifully.

Now, with the love spell at her disposal, she was ready to take things to the next level. She was going to make Kaiden fall deeply in love with her, and once he did, she would have him right where she wanted him.

Benedicta appeared in front of Kaiden's door, She knocked softly, and a few minutes later, the door creaked open.

Kaiden stood in the doorway, looking a little confused.

 "What are you doing here this late?" he asked, his voice tinged with surprise.

Benedicta smiled, her eyes locked on his. Instead of responding, she muttered the words of the love spell under her breath. Kaiden's eyes glazed over, and he spaced out for a moment before a goofy smile spread across his face.

"Love, I've been waiting for you all day," he said, his voice dripping with adoration.

Benedicta's heart skipped a beat as she stepped inside, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. 

"Well, I'm here to make you feel good," she purred, closing the door behind her.

She wrapped her arms around Kaiden's waist, pulling him close. Her hands began to roam his body, and Kaiden didn't seem to mind. In fact, he seemed to be enjoying it.

As they stared into each other's eyes, Benedicta could see the spell taking hold. Kaiden's eyes were filled with a deep longing, and his lips were parted, inviting her to kiss him.

Just as their lips were about to touch, a hand reached out from behind Benedicta, grabbing her hair and yanking her backward. Benedicta let out a painful yell as her hair was almost uprooted from her scalp.

She stumbled backward, her eyes wide with shock and pain. As she turned to face her attacker, she met Maledicta's glare. Maledicta's eyes were blazing with fury, and her grip on Benedicta's hair was like a vice.

"What are you trying to do with my man?" Maledicta spat, her voice deadly.

             (THE BOOK)

Maledicta's grip on Benedicta's hair tightened, her eyes blazing with fury. "What are you doing with my man?" she spat, her voice venomous.

Kaiden, still under the influence of the love spell, stumbled forward, his eyes fixed on Maledicta. 

"Don't hurt my love," he yelled, trying to release Maledicta's hand from her grip.

Maledicta's eyes flicked to Kaiden, and for a moment, Benedicta saw a glimmer of fear in her eyes. But then, Maledicta's expression hardened, and she turned back to Benedicta.

"What did you do to him?" Maledicta asked, her voice cold and detached.

Benedicta tried to hide the pain she was feeling, her scalp throbbing from Maledicta's grip. 

"Why did you think I did something to him?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant. 

"What if he just doesn't want you anymore?" She scoffed.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her grip on Benedicta's hair tightening. 

"I know him, and I don't think he'll ever want to be with you, even if we're no longer together," she said, her voice dripping with contempt.

Since Kaiden kept interfering, Maledicta vanished out of the room with Benedicta. They reappeared in the middle of the school, the empty corridors echoing with their footsteps.

"Today, I'll make all the students know the kind of person you truly are," Maledicta said, her eyes blazing with fury.

Benedicta smirked, trying to hide her fear. 

"And how are you going to do that?" she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

 "Do you think they'll believe everything that comes out of your mouth?Just a fake cry from from me and you will blame instead"Benedicta added with a smile.

Maledicta's smile was cold as she stare at Benedicta.

 "They will, after they see this," she said, and the book of black magic that Benedicta had been hiding appeared immediately.

Benedicta's eyes widened in horror as she stared at the book. She quickly stood up, trying to grab it, but the book vanished and reappeared in another place. She tried to take it again, but the same thing happened again.

Maledicta's eyes gleamed with triumph. "So, are you going to tell me what you did to him, or should I call the students' attention?" she asked, her voice dripping with malice.

Benedicta could hear the voices of some students approaching, and she knew she was running out of time.

 "Ten seconds to go," Maledicta muttered, her eyes glinting with coldness.

Benedicta's fear turned to panic as she realized she was trapped. 

"I enchanted him into liking me, but I can reverse it," she said quickly, her voice trembling with fear.

Maledicta's expression didn't change, "Then do it now." She muttered coldly.

Benedicta quickly closed her eyes and muttered some words under her breath. 

"He'll be asleep now, and by the time he wakes up, he'll be okay," she said, her voice shaking with relief.

Maledicta didn't say anything, and Benedicta couldn't see her expression. But then, Maledicta turned to leave.

   “What about the book?” Benedicta quickly asked.

   “It could still be useful” Maledicta saidi and vanished, leaving Benedicta standing alone in the corridor.

Benedicta's relief turned to anger as she realized she had been outsmarted. 

"You think you've won, but you haven't," she muttered to herself, her eyes blazing with fury.

But when the students appeared, Benedicta quickly pasted a fake smile on her face, hiding her true feelings.

 "Hey, guys," she said, waving at them and the juniors bow in respect.

Meanwhile, Maledicta arrived in Kaiden's room, finding him already asleep on the ground. She picked him up gently and laid him on the bed, her eyes softening as she looked at him.

Kaiden was crying in his sleep, his face twisted in a mixture of fear and pain. Maledicta's heart went out to him as she realized he must have been having a nightmare.

As she listened to his muttered words, Maledicta's eyes widened in horror. "Please, don't kill me," Kaiden muttered, his voice trembling with fear.

   He was actually having a nightmare of a young boy sorrounded by a lot of people, they were trying to throw him into a burning fire.

Maledicta's expression turned fierce, her eyes blazing with anger. She pulled Kaiden closer, holding him tightly as she tried to comfort him.

As Kaiden continued to cry, Maledicta started patting his back, trying to soothe him. Slowly but surely, Kaiden's cries subsided, and he fell asleep in Maledicta's arms.

Maledicta watched him for a while, her eyes softening as she looked at him. 

"He must have pass through a lot” she muttered, soon, she also fell asleep.

It was a rare day off for the students, and the counpound was filled with the sound of laughter and idle chatter. Some students were lounging in the sun, while others were engaged in lively games of tag or hide-and-seek.

But amidst all the revelry, two figures were seen sneaking out of the school. They moved stealthily, trying not to draw attention to themselves as they made their way towards the back gate.

Once they were outside, they quickened their pace, trekking through the dense forest that surrounded the school. The trees seemed to close in around them, casting deep shadows that made it difficult to see.

But the two figures pressed on, their eyes fixed on some point in the distance. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they emerged into a small clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an old, dilapidated house, its walls cracked and weathered with age.

Aka, one of the two figures, made a move to vanish into the house, but Ryder, the other figure, quickly caught her arm. 

"You can't vanish into my grandfather's house," he whispered urgently.

 "You'll be in trouble. We have to walk in." He added.

Aka nodded, and together they approached the house. The front door was already open, creaking gently in the breeze. They tiptoed inside, trying not to make a sound.

An old man was asleep in a chair, his chin slumped against his chest. Ryder and Aka exchanged a nervous glance before moving quietly past him into the bedroom.

Once they were inside, Ryder gestured to a small door hidden behind a tapestry. 

"This is where he keeps the book," he whispered.

Aka's eyes lit up with excitement as she reached for the door. But Ryder caught her hand, holding her back. 

"Let me do it,There may be a trap." He said.

Aka nodded, and Ryder carefully opened the door. A series of arrows shot out, but Ryder and Aka were quick to dodge them.

As the arrows clattered harmlessly to the floor, Aka reached down and picked up the book. She stood up, a bright smile spreading across her face.

Ryder grinned back at her, but his expression quickly turned serious. "We have to make things look the same," he said. "Grandfather gets suspicious easily."

Aka nodded, and Ryder carefully reset the trap. He made another book appear, identical to the one Aka had taken, before closing the door.

As he turned to leave, he realized that Aka was nowhere to be seen. He quickly walked outside, his heart racing with anxiety. His grandfather was starting to stir, and Ryder knew they had to get out of there fast.

He spotted Aka running some distance away, the book clutched tightly in her hand. Ryder took off after her, his feet pounding the earth as he gained on her.

Finally, he caught up to her, grabbing her hand and spinning her around.

 "Why are you running away with the book?" he demanded.

Aka's eyes sparkled with mischief as she smirked up at him. "You said we weren't allowed to read it, right?" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "So you can't."

With that, she punched Ryder in the belly, sending him doubling over in pain. She kicked him twice more before vanishing into thin air.

Ryder groaned, clutching his stomach as he struggled to his feet.

 "I'm doomed," he muttered, shaking his head.

He took off after Aka, to catch up to her and retrieve the book.
.
.
.

Aka appeared in her room, the book clutched tightly in her hand. She had a bright smile on her face as she stared at the book, her eyes shining with excitement. Maybe, just maybe, she would finally be able to find a way to get to Maledicta.

She locked her room with a swift motion of her hand, using her powers to seal the door. Only then did she feel safe enough to open the book.

As she opened the cover, a yellowed page greeted her. The words "Property of Nightshade Wonderland" were emblazoned across the top, followed by a warning: "This book must not fall into the hands of anyone. Its contents are too dangerous for the uninitiated."

Aka shrugged, her eyes scanning the page. She had always been one to disregard warnings, and this was no exception.

She began to read, her eyes widening as she delved deeper into the book. The story was five hundred years old, dating back to the time when Mistress Morwen had just taken over the school from her father.

A strange man had appeared at the school, charming and charismatic. His name was Damian, and Aka's eyes widened as she realized that this was her father.

She continued reading, her eyes growing wider in shock. Her father had come to the school because he had heard about the prophecy of the child Lucan, who would give the demons the strength to take over the world.

The school had been unaware of Damian's true intentions. He had almost ended the students, using them as sacrifices to his dark god. Aka's mind reeled as she read the words, her heart pounding in her chest.

"My father isn't like that," she whispered, shaking her head in shock. "That's not my father."

But the words on the page didn't lie. Damian had been found out, performing his dark ritual in secret. The goddess had cursed him, but he had taken his own life before the curse could take effect.

The curse had then passed to one of his children, and Aka's eyes widened as she realized that this must be why her mother had always been so secretive about her past.

It was only after Damian's death that it was discovered that Mistress Morwen was pregnant with his children. Aka's mind reeled as she realized the implications.

Did that mean...? Could it be...?

The book fell from Aka's hand, her eyes widening in shock. Maledicta and Benedicta were her younger sisters.

The room spun around her, Aka's mind racing with thoughts. Her mother had lied to her about her father's death. Epusa had told her that he had been killed while out hunting, but it seemed that was just a cover story.

Aka stood up, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't believe the truth. She had always thought of Maledicta and Benedicta as her enemies, but now...now she wasn't so sure.

She walked back to the book, her eyes scanning the pages once more. There had to be more to the story, more secrets hidden within the pages.

As she read on, Aka's mind reeled with the implications. She was related to the sisters, and her father's past was far darker than she had ever imagined.

The room grew darker, the shadows deepening as Aka delved deeper into the book. She was uncovering secrets that were meant to remain hidden, secrets that could change everything.
.
.
.
.
       FEW HOURS LATER

Aka stood in front of the book, her eyes scanning the pages with a mixture of shock and disbelief. She had just finished reading the entire book, and what she had discovered was almost too much to bear.

According to the book, Aka was connected to Maledicta in ways she never could have imagined. They shared the same blood, and that made Aka a potential weakness for Maledicta. It was all part of the curse that had been placed upon Maledicta.

But Aka didn't want to believe any of it. She was only going to believe what her mother had told her.

 Aka decided to try out an experiment. She had been keeping a magical stone for some time now, she brought it from hell.

Aka cut her finger and dropped a single drop of blood onto the stone. The stone began to glow, and two figures appeared on its surface. Aka's eyes widened in shock as she realized that the two figures were Maledicta and Benedicta.

She was stunned. This meant that Maledicta and Benedicta were her sisters, connected to her by blood.

"I want her blood," Aka said, her voice barely above a whisper. She pointed at Maledicta's image on the stone, and to her surprise, a single drop of blood appeared before her.

Aka quickly collected the blood in a small container.

With the book and the container of blood in hand, Aka left her room and set out.

Meanwhile, Maledicta was feeling uneasy. She had suddenly started bleeding from the nose, and what's more, she couldn't even see the blood immediately it came out of her nose. She shrugged it off as nothing and continued to listen to the story Belladonna was telling her.

But despite her interest in the story, Maledicta couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She felt a strange sensation, like someone was watching her, and she couldn't help but wonder if it had something to do with the strange occurrence with her nose.
.
.

Aka slipped out of the school, her eyes scanning the surrounding area to make sure no one was watching. 

Benedicta, who had been watching Aka from afar, decided to follow her. She made herself invisible and trailed behind Aka, careful not to make a sound.

Aka kept looking back, her senses on high alert. She could feel like she was being watched, but every time she turned around, there was no one there. She shrugged it off, attributing it to her imagination.

As they approached the coven, Aka's pace slowed. She could see her mother, Epusa, talking to someone in the distance. Aka's instincts told her to hide, and she quickly ducked behind a nearby stone.

Epusa's voice carried on the wind, and Aka's eyes widened as she listened to her mother's conversation.

 "Aren't you going to tell her about her father, Death?" the other person asked.

“I can't. She has to be useful to me. She hasn't been able to achieve anything she promised to do. She couldn't even bring the blood of that girl to me. She's useless, just like her father."Epusa said.

Aka felt a surge of anger and hurt at her mother's words. She had always known that Epusa was demanding and critical, but she had never realized just how much her mother despised her.

The other person spoke up, their voice low and gravelly. "So, what are you going to do now?"

 "Just give her some time, and step in if she continues to be useless." Epusa said.

Aka's eyes narrowed as she listened to her mother's plan. She knew that she had to prove herself to Epusa, but she was beginning to realize that her mother's expectations were impossible to meet.

 "Why don't you try using her blood? It could work, since she's also related to the girl." The person said.

 "I tried it already, but it's useless, just like her." Epusa said.

 Aka carefully made her way out from behind the stone. She approached her mother, a bright smile plastered on her face.

Epusa's expression changed in an instant, a warm smile spreading across her face. "Wow, you're here!" she exclaimed, standing up to greet Aka.

Aka's smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. 

"Just wanted to see you," she said, trying to sound casual.

 "Any news about the girl and the blood?"Epusa asked.

Aka shook her head, trying to appear nonchalant. 

"I couldn't get it yet, and the boy too. Maybe he's not in the school." He said.

Epusa's expression turned angry, but she quickly masked it with a smile. "What?" she asked.

 "I promise to find him soon, and the blood too," Epusa said, trying to sound convincing.

Epusa's smile grew wider, "I trust you," Epusa said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

As Aka turned to leave, Epusa's smile disappeared, replaced by a snarl of anger.

 "She's so useless," Epusa muttered to herself, her voice venomous.

 "How can I have given birth to someone like that?” she said.
.
.
.

Aka appeared back in school, her eyes brimming with tears. The revelation that her own mother was using her had left her feeling heartbroken and betrayed. She stumbled forward, her eyes fixed on the ground as she tried to process her emotions.

As she walked, she noticed the vial of blood still clutched in her hand. With a cry of disgust, she threw it away, watching as it fell on the ground. She started to leave, but a voice stopped her in her tracks.

"So, you're just going to give up?" Benedicta asked, her voice dripping with malice.

Aka turned to face her, her eyes narrowing. "What are you talking about?" she asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

Benedicta smiled, "I know what you are," she said, her voice low and husky. "So, don't try to feign ignorance." She said and pick up the blood.

Aka's eyes flashed with anger, and she drew her sword, its blade glinting in the moonlight. 

"This is none of your business, okay?So, just leave." Aka said.

Benedicta chuckled, her eyes never leaving Aka's face.

 "Well, it is my business,I was planning on using you to achieve my aims, and now that you're useless, I don't think that will work anymore." Benedicta said maniacally.

Aka's face twisted with anger, and she took a step forward, her sword at the ready. 

"Shut up and stay away from me," she snarled.

 "I can't do that,Instead, don't you think I should do what's done to a useless person?" Benedicta asked with a smirk.

With that, she drew her own sword,  Aka's eyes narrowed, and she charged forward, their swords clashing in a flurry of steel and sparks.

The fight was intense, with both women exchanging blows and dodging attacks. Aka's sword sliced through the air, its blade biting deep into the ground as Benedicta dodged to the side. Benedicta retaliated with a swift kick, but Aka was too quick, and she dodged out of the way just in time.

As the fight continued, it became clear that Benedicta was the more skilled swordsman. Her blows were precise and deadly, and Aka found herself struggling to keep up.

Despite her best efforts, Aka couldn't seem to gain the upper hand. Benedicta's sword sliced through her defenses, and Aka stumbled backward, her eyes wide with fear. 

And then, in a flash of steel, it was over. Benedicta's sword sliced through Aka's neck, severing her head from her body. Aka's eyes went wide, and her body crumpled to the ground, her head rolling away from her body.

Benedicta stood over her, a wicked smirk on her face as she stared at the blood on her sword. She cleaned the blood on Aka's body, and that's when she noticed that Aka was hiding something under her clothes. She lifted up Aka's clothes and smiled when she saw the book.

She brought it out and smiled when she saw what was written at the beginning. She also saw the stone and picked it up, feeling its power coursing through her veins. With a satisfied smile, she tucked the book and stone into her pocket and left, leaving Aka's headless body behind.

As Benedicta walked away, Aka's body began to change color, her skin turning a strange shade of gray. The air around her seemed to distort, and a strange energy began to emanate from her body.

         (THE GOLDEN BOOK)

The loud sound of the emergency alarm pierced through the air, jolting many students out of their beds. Some groggily got up, rubbing the sleep from their eyes, while others quickly threw on their clothes and rushed outside.

As they gathered in the courtyard, confusion etched on their faces, they saw a crowd of students gathered around something. Kaiden, still feeling a little sleepy, wandered over to see what all the fuss was about.

His eyes widened in shock as he took in the sight before him. Aka's headless body lay on the ground, her skin dark and her veins greenish. The students around him were whispering in shock, their voices filled with fear and disgust.

"She's a demon," someone whispered.

"I can't believe this," another student said, her fvoice shaking.

"To think she's been here for months, I'm terrified," a boy said, his eyes wide with fear.

Ryder stood frozen, his eyes fixed on Aka's body. He looked confused, unsure of what was happening. Kaiden stood beside him, equally shocked.

Maledicta stood a little way off, her eyes fixed on Aka's body. Her expression was blank, but her eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness.

Mistress Morwen arrived a few minutes later, her face pale and worried. "I'm so sorry," she said, her voice trembling. "I had no idea...I didn't know she was a demon."

Benedicta stepped forward, a bright smile on her face. "We'll make sure something like this never happens again," she said. "We'll get rid of any other demons in this school."

The junior students chorused their agreement, but Belladonna rolled her eyes. 

"She're so eager to please," she muttered to Maledicta.

Maledicta smiled wryly. "You have no idea what my sister is capable of."

Belladonna raised an eyebrow. "Really? Then why did you leave her? She obviously hates you."

Maledicta's expression turned cold. "I know that."

"Then why didn't you expose her?" Belladonna asked. "She's the one who shot arrows at you during the festival."

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger. "I know that."

"So, what are you waiting for?" Belladonna asked.

"It's not time yet, but soon. I won't sit back and watch if she tries anything stupid again."Maledicta said.

 "Everyone, please return to your classes. Let's try to get back to normal."Mistress Morwen said.

As the students began to disperse, Cassius and Thane carefully lifted Aka's body onto a wooden cart. Benedicta smiled sweetly.

 "We'll make sure to burn her, so she can't resurrect." She said.

Mistress Morwen nodded, her eyes sad. "Let's take her away." She said.

As they carried Aka's body away, Belladonna turned to Maledicta. "Do you think Benedicta killed her?" She asked.

Maledicta's expression was unreadable. "Maybe." She said.

Belladonna raised an eyebrow. "You're not going to do anything about it?"

"Not yet."Maledicta said and left.

Mistress Morwen stood by, her eyes sad. She stared at Aka's hand, noticing the handkerchief clutched in her fingers. It looked like the one Damien, Aka's and Maledicta's father, had made for her too.

She felt a pang of sorrow, realizing that Aka must have been Damien's daughter. The rumors had been true.

“Maybe we should just find her head and burried her body” Mistress Morwen said.

“She deserves to be burn, she kill a lot of innocent students already, and who know what happen to her head, maybe some animal has enten it already” Benedicta said.

With a heavy heart, Mistress Morwen nodded. "Burn her." She said.

Benedicta's smile grew wider, her eyes gleaming with triumph. As the flames consumed Aka's body, erasing all evidence of her demonic existence.

Ryder walked alone to his room, his mind reeling with thoughts and emotions. He was still trying to process the shocking news of Aka's death. Just yesterday, they had snuck out of the school together, determined to uncover the secrets of Maledicta. And now, Aka was gone.

As he walked, Ryder couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt and regret. He had been so blind, so foolish. Aka had been using him all along, manipulating him to get what she wanted. And he had fallen for it, hook, line, and sinker.

Ryder's thoughts were a jumbled mess of emotions. He was confused, angry, and sad all at once. He didn't know what to feel or what to do. All he knew was that he had to get the book back. It was the only way to make things right.

He quickened his pace, his heart racing with anticipation. He hoped that the seniors hadn't already searched Aka's room and taken the book. He had to get to it before anyone else did.

Just as he turned a corner, he bumped into Arachne, who was approaching him from the opposite direction. She almost fell, but Ryder quickly caught her and helped her to stand upright.

"Where are you going?" Ryder asked, trying to hide his emotions.

Arachne looked up at him, her eyes filled with concern. "I was coming after you," she said gently.

 "I know you liked her, and now she's dead. You must be sad." She added.

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise. "Are you worried about me?" he asked, a small grin spreading across his face.

Arachne looked away, her cheeks flushing. "Maybe I shouldn't have been," she said, starting to leave.

But Ryder quickly grabbed her arm, holding her back. "Her death was shocking, but I wasn't that sad about it," he said seriously.

 "She did something surprising to me yesterday, but I'd rather not talk about it. I have more important things to say." He added.

Arachne's eyes narrowed,"What is it?" she asked, relaxing a little.

Ryder took a deep breath, his eyes locked on Arachne's. "I think I did something very stupid, and it may have caused serious problems," he said, his voice laced with regret. 

"What should I do?" He asked.

"You should do everything you can to amend your mistakes," she said gently.

Ryder nodded, . "I should do that," he said. "At least that will be the punishment for my foolishness."

Without thinking, Ryder pulled Arachne into a tight hug.

“What are you doing?” She asked.

 "I really need this right now," he whispered, his voice sending shivers down Arachne's spine. "Please."

Arachne's eyes widened in surprise, but she quickly relaxed into the hug. 

"Just for a few minutes," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ryder closed his eyes, feeling a sense of peace wash over him. For a moment, he forgot about Aka, the book, and all his troubles. All he knew was the warmth of Arachne's body, the comfort of her presence.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Ryder pulled back, his eyes locked on Arachne's. "Thank you," he whispered, Arachne smile back and watch him go.

The seniors gathered in Aka's room, their faces somber as they began to pack up her belongings. Belladonna carefully placed each item into a container, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of something suspicious.

"To me, she was just like us," Belladonna said, her voice tinged with sadness. "She had everything we have, nothing strange."

Lilith nodded in agreement, her eyes scanning the room. "Her death is suspicious, though. Who exactly killed her, and why are they hiding the fact?" She said.

 "It could be Maledicta. You know she can sense demon at once."Cassius said.

But before he could finish, Belladonna and Thane snapped at him in unison. "She's not!" they exclaimed, their faces stern.

Cassius looked taken aback, his eyes wide with surprise. "Wow, sorry guys. I didn't mean to upset you." He laugh.

Thane's expression softened, and he looked down at the floor. "I just feel bad for her," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Well, it wouldn't be surprising if you had a crush on her," Lilith said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

The room fell silent, with all eyes fixed on Thane. He looked up, his face flushing with embarrassment. "What are you talking about?" he scoffed, trying to play it cool.

But Lilith just smiled angrily.

"Nothing, I just know the type of person you are. One minute you're kissing a girl, and the next minute you're like, 'That didn't happen.'" She scoffed.

Thane's face turned bright red, and he looked like he was about to explode. "I am not like that!" he snapped, his voice rising in anger.

 "You're the one who does something and then regrets it later." He snapped.

Lilith's eyes flashed with anger, and she took a step forward. "I am not! It wasn't even that good," she spat, her voice venomous.

The room was silent, with all eyes fixed on the two arguing seniors. 

 "Did something happen between you two?" Belladonna asked, her eyes fixed on Thane and Lilith.

But before she could get an answer, Thane and Lilith both yelled "No!" in unison and stormed out of the room, leaving the other seniors looking at each other in confusion.

The room was silent for a while, with no one daring to speak. Finally, Belladonna broke the silence, her voice soft and gentle. 

"Let's just focus on why we here, you how they are?" she said, her eyes scanning the room.

The other seniors nodded in agreement, and they continued packing up Aka's belongings, their faces somber and their hearts heavy with grief. It was obvious that it was only Benedicta that was happy about her death.

Belladonna heard a knock at her door and made her way to answer it. She opened the door to find Cassius standing there, a bright smile on his face and a flower in his hand. Her heart skipped a beat as she took in the sight of him, but she quickly composed herself and tried to close the door.

However, Cassius was too quick. He caught the door and pushed his way into the room, his eyes locked on Belladonna's.

 "Why are you here?" she asked, trying to sound stern despite the flutter in her chest.

Cassius didn't seem to notice her unease. He walked into the room, his eyes never leaving hers, and dropped to one knee in front of her. He held out the flower, his hand trembling slightly as he did so.

Belladonna gasped, her eyes widening in surprise. She hadn't expected Cassius to be so romantic. For a moment, she forgot to be angry with him, forgot to be wary of his intentions.

"Miss Belladonna," Cassius said, his voice low and sincere.

 "I am so sorry for behaving like a jerk. I want you to know that I am a changed person now. I just want you to give me a chance to be your friend, to prove to you that I'm worthy of your trust and to be with you" He added.

As he spoke, Belladonna could see the sincerity in his eyes, could sense the s emanating from him. She was taken aback by his words.

"I will think about it," she said finally, trying to sound nonchalant despite the turmoil in her chest.

Cassius's face lit up with a bright smile. "Thank you," he said, his voice filled with gratitude. He stood up and hugged her tightly, his arms wrapping around her like a vice.

Belladonna was taken aback by the hug, but she didn't push him away. Instead, she found herself hugging him back, her arms wrapping around him as she breathed in the scent of his cologne.

"I didn't give you permission to do that yet," she said, trying to sound stern.

Cassius chuckled, his chest vibrating against hers. "That was Cass," he lied.

Belladonna smiled, her heart skipping a beat at the sight of his smile. She hugged him back, her arms tightening around him as she felt a sense of happiness wash over her.

She was feeling happy, but she wasn't going to let Cassius know that. She was going to make him work for her, make him prove himself worthy of her.

"You won't regret giving me another chance, mate," Cassius said, his voice filled with confidence.

"I haven't given you another chance," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Cassius chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I know you will," he said, his voice filled with certainty. He hugged her more tightly, his arms wrapping around her like a vice.

But as the moment passed, Belladonna's caution returned. She pushed Cassius away, her eyes narrowing as she looked at him.

"Don't get too ahead of yourself, Cassius," she said. But Cassius keep smiling.

   “Hey buddy” Cass said in his head, the moment he was out her room, he look so happy because he is finally talking to him again.

Benedicta made herself invisible before entering the coven, her eyes scanning the area to make sure no one was watching. 

As she approached the throne room, she could feel the air grow thick with anticipation. She took a deep breath, steadying herself before making herself visible.

The moment she appeared in front of Queen Epusa, the queen sprang up from her throne, her eyes blazing with anger. 

"What are you doing here?" she demanded, her voice dripping with venom.

Benedicta smiled,"To see you, and probably have a deal," she muttered fearlessly.

Queen Epusa's face twisted with rage. "How dare you," she spat, her hand rising to summon the guards. "Take her away."

But Benedicta was prepared for this. She suddenly threw the bag she was holding to the queen, who caught it instinctively. 

"I think you should check this out before making that decision," Benedicta said.

The queen's eyes widened as she opened the bag, and a demon rushed forward to take it from her. The demon pulled out Aka's head, and the queen's eyes went wide with shock and horror.

"What did you do to my daughter?" Queen Epusa demanded, her voice deadly calm. She took a step forward, her snakes hissing and spitting in agitation.

But Benedicta wasn't afraid. She smiled, "I killed her because she was useless," she said, her voice dripping with malice. "Look what I found with her."

She held up the book, and the queen's eyes widened in shock. 

"She came here with my sister's blood but decided not to give you," Benedicta added, holding up the vial of blood.

The queen's face twisted with rage, but then she suddenly laughed. 

"You must be the other twin," she said.

Benedicta smiled,"Of course, I am,And I am ready to help you if you are ready to do what I want." Benedicta said.

The queen raised an eyebrow, her expression intrigued. "What do you want?" she asked, her voice calm.

Benedicta's smile grew wider. "To reign beside you," she said.

The queen frowned, but then she suddenly smiled.

 "Sure," she said, her voice dripping with malice.

Benedicta's eyes lit up with excitement as she held out her hand, offering the queen the vial of blood. The queen took it, calling out the book and dropping the blood on it. They waited for a while, but nothing happened.

"The blood is useless," the queen said, her voice angry.

Benedicta shrugged,  "I think you should blame your daughter for it,Unlike her, I am useful and more capable. I think what you should be worried about is how to get rid of my sister. According to this book, she is destined to kill Lucan, your supposed savior." Benedicta said.

The queen's face twisted with rage, but then she suddenly smiled.

 "I know that, and that's why you will help me to kill her." She said.

Benedicta raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical.

 "Do you think I can?" she asked. 

"She is powerful, and you know." She added.

The queen's smile grew wider. "You said you are capable, then prove yourself." She said.

"I found this on your daughter," she said, holding up the stone.

 "Did you know what it is?" She asked.

The queen's eyes lit up with excitement as she took the stone from Benedicta. 

"This will make our work easier," she said, her voice dripping with malice.

As Benedicta left the throne room some minutes later, the queen watched her go, a calculating glint in her eye. The smile on her face disappeared, replaced by a look of coldness.

"She killed your daughter, and you decided to work with her," a voice said to the queen, echoing her thoughts.

The queen turned to face the speaker, a cold smile spreading across her face.

 "I read her fate already," she said. 

"Her sister is a blessing sent to protect their world from Lucan, but the people thought she was cursed. They are so foolish. The one who left here now is the cursed one. She was cursed to always be jealous of her sister until she dies miserably, and I will make that happen. She will pay dearly for killing my daughter” Epusa said venomously.

Maledicta and Kaiden strolled hand in hand through the forest, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and each other's company. They had been busy lately, and it was rare for them to have time alone together.

As they walked, "How did you feel about Aka's death?"Kaiden suddenly asked.,

Maledicta's expression turned thoughtful. "Did you feel bad for her?" she asked, her voice soft.

Kaiden nodded. "I just think it was too cruel. She was young and had her whole life ahead of her." She said.

"Maybe that's true, but she killed innocent people too. She wasn't entirely innocent."Maledicta said.

Kaiden nodded, his eyes understanding. "That's true," he said, and then he cupped Maledicta's cheeks, his eyes gazing into hers.

 "You're getting prettier every day, and I'm glad you're mine." He said, changing the topic.

Maledicta's face flushed, and she looked away, her heart skipping a beat.

 "I'm so obsessed with you that I think I might die if you're not here with me," she said honestly.

 "Me too, so let's stick together forever," he said, and they nodded, their lips meeting in a tender kiss.

As they pulled away, "I want to do something special for you, let go to your room" Maledicta said.

Kaiden's eyes lit up with excitement. "What is it?" he asked, and Maledicta smiled mischievously.

But before she could respond, Benedicta appeared on a nearby tree branch, her eyes fixed on the couple with a scowl. She brought out the stone, her eyes flashing with malice.

"You can request anything if you have the same blood," she remembered Epusa's words, and with a wicked smile, she cut her finger, dropping her blood onto the stone.

Maledicta's image appeared on the stone, and Benedicta's smile grew wider.

 "I want her dead," she said, her voice dripping with malice.

The stone glowed, and Maledicta suddenly stopped walking, her eyes widening in shock. 

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked worriedly, but Maledicta pushed him away instead of responding.

A massive tornado erupted around her, lifting her off the ground. Kaiden's eyes widened in horror as he tried to rush to her side, but an invisible shield threw him back.

Benedicta chuckled from her perch on the tree branch, her eyes gleaming with malevolence. Maledicta started screaming as she felt her life slipping away, her body tossed about like a rag doll within the tornado.

Kaiden was weak and desperate, trying to find a way to save Maledicta. He kept running toward the tornado, but the shield kept throwing him back. Soon, he couldn't hear Maledicta's screams anymore.

"Are you okay?" he asked fearfully, moving closer to the tornado, but the shield threw him back again.

"Maledicta!" he screamed with all his might, his voice echoing through the forest.

And then, something strange happened. The blood on the golden book, which Epusa had kept hidden away, began to glow brightly. The book flung open, and the mark on Kaiden's back began to glow, moving up to his forehead.

His hair began to float, and a massive sword suddenly appeared in his arm. With a fierce cry, he slashed at the shield, shattering it and dispelling the tornado.

Maledicta collapsed gently to the ground, her body limp and lifeless. Kaiden rushed to her side, his eyes scanning her face frantically.

Benedicta gasped in shock, her eyes wide with horror. The stone in her hand broke into pieces, and a massive storm swept through the forest, throwing her far away. Her head hit a rock, and she fainted.

The sword disappeared from Kaiden's hand, and he fainted, his body crumpling beside Maledicta's. The mark on his forehead slowly faded, moving back to its original position on his back. The golden book closed, its secrets hidden once more.

As the storm subsided, the forest grew quiet once more. Maledicta and Kaiden lay motionless on the ground.

   (DANGEROUS YET….FEELS GOOD)

The bright sun streaming through the window was what finally woke Maledicta up, her groggy mind slowly coming back online. She groaned, her head pounding with a dull ache, and looked around in confusion. She couldn't understand what was wrong or how she had gotten there.

"You're awake," a voice said behind her, and she turned to see her mother, Mistress Morwen, standing in the doorway with a look of relief on her face.

Maledicta rubbed her temples, trying to clear the fog from her mind. "What happened?" she asked, her voice hoarse from sleep.

Mistress Morwen walked over to her daughter's bedside and sat down beside her. "I wanted to ask that too," she said. "We found you and Kaiden unconscious on the ground in the forest. There was a great storm, and Belladonna said you weren't in your room, so we searched for you and found you both late at night. What's wrong, Maledicta?" She asked.

Maledicta shook her head, trying to remember. "I don't know too," she said. "I was with Kaiden in the forest, but then something happened. I can't even remember it." She muttered.

Mistress Morwen's expression turned concerned. "It's strange," she said. "I felt really scared for some unknown reason. Are you sure you didn't see anything strange?" She asked.

Maledicta thought hard, but her mind was a complete blank. "I didn't," she said. "Where's Kaiden?"

"He's resting," she said. "Maybe you were both affected by the great storm. He could take longer to wake up. I think he's in a vegetative state." He said.

Maledicta's heart sank, and she felt a wave of guilt wash over her. "That's my fault," she said sadly. "I should have stayed away from him."

Mistress Morwen put a comforting hand on her daughter's shoulder. "Stop saying that," she said. "It just happened, not like you knew it would."

Maledicta didn't say anything, lost in her own thoughts as she tried to remember what had happened the night before.

Mistress Morwen stood up, her eyes filled with concern. "You should rest now," she said. "I'll come back later."

Maledicta nodded, still deep in thought. As soon as her mother left, she sat down on her bed, her mind racing with questions. What had happened the night before? Why couldn't she remember?

Suddenly, she had a quick flashback of a tornado surrounding her, and her head began to pound with a severe headache. She grabbed her head in pain, feeling like her brain was going to explode.

"Don't try to recall," a voice in her head said. "It will come to you at the right time."

Maledicta's eyes widened in surprise. It had been a long time since the voice in her head had spoken to her.

"You should see him," the voice said again.

Maledicta smiled, She vanished out of the room, reappearing in Kaiden's room. Her heart sank as she saw his pale face, but she was relieved to see that he didn't have any visible wounds.

"He will be okay," she assured herself, her voice barely above a whisper.

She grabbed his arm, feeling a sense of comfort as she touched him. She kissed his forehead, her lips gentle against his skin. Then, she laid her head on his chest, listening to his gentle heartbeat.

Benedicta's eyes sprang open, and she could feel a searing pain in her arm. She looked down to see a little creature biting at her arm, its tiny teeth sunk deep into her skin. Her eyes turned red with rage, and she grabbed the creature, strangling it until it turned to dust.

She stood up, brushing off her clothes, and that's when she noticed she was lying on the ground. She remembered hitting her head the night before and realized she must have passed out. She knew once again that her plan had failed, and that made her really angry.

But the anger disappeared when she remembered the previous night. Kaiden had been acting strangely, and she could swear he had used some kind of superpower. She was confused and decided to visit the queen to see if she had any information.

As she arrived at the palace, she was greeted by Epusa's cold gaze. 

"I hope you come here with good news," Epusa said, standing up from her throne. 

"Do you bring your sister's head, just like you brought my daughter?" She asked further.

Benedicta shook her head,  "I couldn't do that," she said. "Something came up." She said.

"About that, I sense Lucan's power last night. It was coming from your school." Epusa said.

Benedicta's eyes widened in surprise. "That means my suspicion is right, then. I might have found Lucan." She said.

Epusa's face lit up with excitement. "What? Where is he? You should have brought him." She asked.

Benedicta hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. "This is just an assumption. I am still going to check for the mark. It's supposed to be on his back, right?" she asked, looking at Epusa for confirmation.

Epusa nodded, "Yes, that's right."

Benedicta took a deep breath before speaking.

 "I want to change the deal we have," she said body.

Epusa raised an eyebrow, "What do you mean?" She asked while coming closer to him.

Benedicta's eyes locked onto Epusa's. "If I bring Lucan to you, I want to be his queen, reigning beside him." She said.

Epusa's face twisted with anger, but then she nodded. "Do as you please."

Benedicta smiled, feeling a sense of triumph. 

"What if the Lucan is close to my sister?" she asked.

Epusa's expression turned cold. "That can never happen. You should do anything to stop that. They must not be close or have intimate relations. That could ruin our plan." She said.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. "I won't allow that to happen," she said. 

"I will do my confirmation as soon as possible, and once it's done, I will bring him." She said.

Epusa nodded, a satisfied smile spreading across her face. "Good."

As Benedicta turned to leave, Epusa's voice stopped her. "What about the stone? It's one of our family's inheritance."

Benedicta shrugged, "The stone is gone." She said.

Epusa's eyes widened in surprise, her face pale. "How is that possible?" she asked, her voice trembling with rage. The stone was one of the strongest objects the family possessed.

Benedicta shrugged again, "I don't know.maybe you are wrong" she said and left with Epusa glaring at her back.

Mistress Morwen was about to leave her office when she suddenly felt a presence behind her. She turned, and her eyes widened in surprise as she saw the Nightshade elders standing before her. They were respectable people, known for their wisdom and power.

Mistress Morwen bowed her head in respect, her heart racing with anticipation. "Elders," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "What brings you here?"

One of the elders stepped forward, his eyes piercing as he spoke. "We sense Lucan's energy in your school last night."

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened in shock. "I sensed it too," she said finally, accepting her suspicions.

 "But it was shocking. I couldn't believe it." She said.

The elder's expression turned grave. "But how is that possible? We killed the boy when he was just a boy. We burned him." One of them said.

Mistress Morwen shook her head,

"That's what I couldn't understand," she said.

 "That child can't live. We have to get rid of him.Remember, he killed his mother and all the workers in their house. He will ruin us if he is alive." Another elder said.

The room fell silent, the weight of the elders' words hanging in the air. Mistress Morwen knew what they were saying was true. Lucan was a threat to their world, and he had to be stopped.

Another elder spoke up, his eyes fixed on Mistress Morwen. "And that's why it's time. You have to tell your daughter the purpose she was born for. She has to kill him before he grows too strong to defeat." 

Mistress Morwen's heart sank, her mind racing with doubts. How was she going to tell Maledicta all this? Her daughter would never forgive her.

"How am I going to tell her all this now?" Mistress Morwen asked, her voice laced with frustration. "And how are we going to find Lucan?"

The elders' expressions turned stern. "He is in your school," they said in unison. "We can sense him. Find him and get rid of him."

With that, the elders vanished, leaving Mistress Morwen alone in her office. She slumped into her chair, her head in her hands.

"This is so complicated," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "How am I going to tell Maledicta all this? She will never forgive me."

Mistress Morwen sat there for a long time, her mind racing with thoughts and doubts. She knew what she had to do, but she was afraid of the consequences.

Ryder stood outside his grandfather's house, his heart racing with anxiety. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves before entering the house.

As he stepped inside, he saw his grandfather sitting in the living room, just like the last time. His grandfather didn't even look up, as if he knew Ryder was staring at him.

"Why are you here?" his grandfather finally asked, his voice low and gravelly, after several minutes of silence.

Ryder swallowed hard, his throat dry. "I...I stole the book you hid," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

His grandfather didn't react, didn't even open his eyes. "Why are you telling me now?" he asked, his voice devoid of emotion.
Ryder was taken aback by the question. "You knew?" he asked, his voice shaking slightly.

"Of course."His grandfather muttered.

Ryder felt a wave of shame wash over him. "I'm sorry, Grandpa. I wasn't thinking straight," he said, his voice filled with regret. He knelt down in front of his grandfather, his head bowed in shame.

His grandfather finally opened his eyes, his gaze piercing. "Where is the book?" he asked.

Ryder hesitated before answering. "The girl I gave it to is dead, and I couldn't find it. I think her killer might have it." He said.

"You've ruined things, Ryder. I wanted that girl to live a normal life, a happy life. But you've ruined it." He said.

Ryder felt a pang of guilt. "She didn't have a happy life because she was cursed," he said, trying to defend himself.

But his grandfather shook his head. "That's what we want you all to believe. She's a blessing, our hero." He said.

Ryder's eyes widened in surprise. "Then why is she like that?" he asked.

His grandfather's expression turned somber. "Live like her, Ryder. Live alone, being deserted by people, being misjudged. And you'll understand." He said.

Ryder felt a lump form in his throat. He couldn't imagine living a life like that.

"What about the punishment she faces, like the thunderstorms?" Ryder askef.

"That's to remind her that she hasn't fulfilled her destiny."His grandfather said.

Ryder's eyes widened in horror. "That's cruel," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

His grandfather nodded. "Yes, and I think things are about to get even crueler because of you." He said.

 "I won't sit and watch, Grandpa. I'll do something to make it right. All of this is my fault." He said.

"We'll see, Ryder. We'll see.” his grandfather said.

Maledicta's eyes were fixed on Kaiden's pale face, her heart racing with worry. She had been beside him all day, and he hadn't even opened his eyes. She was starting to get anxious, wondering what if it took a long time before he woke up. How would she cope with that?

Just as she was about to panic, Kaiden's eyes flickered open, and a weak smile spread across his handsome face as he saw her. Maledicta's heart skipped a beat as she felt a wave of relief wash over her.

"Are you okay?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden nodded, his smile growing slightly wider. "I'm fine," he said, his voice weak but reassuring.

Maledicta's eyes scanned his face, searching for any signs of discomfort. "You must be hungry," she said. "What do you want to eat?"

Kaiden's eyes drifted closed, and he shook his head slightly. "I just want to bathe," he muttered. "I don't like how my body feels."

Maledicta nodded, her heart going out to him. "I'll help, okay?" she said, and with a wave of her hand, they appeared in the bathtub immediately.

Maledicta stood beside the tub, gently washing Kaiden's body with a soft sponge. Kaiden closed his eyes, a look of relaxation washing over his face as he let out a soft sigh.

As Maledicta continued to wash him, she asked, "Do you know what happened?"

Kaiden's eyes flickered open, and he looked up at her. "I don't know," he said. "But I felt really weird. I'm just glad you're alright. I would never have forgiven myself if something had happened to you." He said.

Maledicta smiled, her heart warming at his words. "You know I can take care of myself," she said. "So stop worrying about me."

Kaiden's eyes locked onto hers, his expression serious. "I can never do that," he said. "I promise to protect you forever."

Maledicta's heart skipped a beat at his words, and she felt a rush of emotion. She leaned in, her lips meeting Kaiden's in a soft, gentle kiss. Kaiden reciprocated immediately, deepening the kiss as they lost themselves in each other.

As they pulled away, Kaiden climbed out of the bathtub, his trousers dripping wet from the water. He scooped Maledicta up in his arms and carried her to the bed, his movements swift and effortless.

Maledicta was shocked at how quickly Kaiden had regained his strength. He took off his trousers and climbed on top of her, his lips tracing a path from her mouth to her neck, where he gave her sweet, gentle bites.

Maledicta closed her eyes, her hands roaming over Kaiden's body as she lost herself in the sensation. As her hand moved over the mark on his back, it shone brightly, but they were too caught up in the moment to notice.

The sky suddenly went red as their intense make out increased, there were loud thunderstorms but they were too engrossed in what they were doing.

    Kaiden took off Maledicta gown and his eyes roamed around her beautiful body, he realized this is the first time he will be seeing her body.

    “You are so pretty” he said and kissed her cleavage, Maledicta blushing feeling a little nervous.

    “You can tell me to stop if you don't feel comfortable with what I am about to Do” he whispered to her ear and she nodded. Then one of his hand captured her b**b and the other one roam around her sexy body. His warm mouth wrap around her other b**b and her eyes rolled, it felt so nice and strange, she has never experienced anything like this before. Her back aches on the bed as he continues to wonder on her body, what she didn't know existed, she felt so good and didn't ever want him to stop.

    “Should I continue?” He asked after he stopped. She didn't respond and just pushed him down to kiss her. The mark kept glowing but their eyes were close to notice it in the dark room.

     “This might hurt, should I continue?” He asked again, he just wanted to make sure, she wasn't feeling any discomfort. She nodded and both stared at each other as he slowly entered her.

    She looked surprised because of the sharp pain she felt but she didn't want him to stop. Kaiden watches her face before moving gently. Maledicta let out a breath because she felt amazing.

    He started moving faster and a heavy rain started falling immediately, the thunder striking loudly. It was as if the sky wanted to fall because of the rain.

               (BURSTED)

Kaiden's gentle whisper woke Maledicta up from her slumber.

 "Morning, sweetheart," he said, his lips brushing against her forehead.

Maledicta smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. She kissed him back, and they spent a few moments just enjoying each other's company.

They had spent the whole night having fun, and it seemed like their strength had been refilled. Maledicta felt rejuvenated, and Kaiden looked like he was glowing with happiness.

"Are you okay?" Kaiden asked, his eyes scanning her face.

Maledicta found herself hiding her face in his chest, feeling a little shy. "Can we not talk about that?" she said gently.

Kaiden laughed, his chest vibrating against her face.

 "But I couldn't forget it," he said, his voice low.

 "I dreamt about it all night." He added naughtily.

Maledicta's face grew hotter, and she pulled away from him. "You're becoming weird," she said, trying to sound stern.

Kaiden grinned naughtily.

 "We should go for breakfast," Maledicta said, standing up.

Kaiden stared at her naked body, his eyes roaming over her curves. 

"Stop looking, pervert," Maledicta said, laughing.

Kaiden chuckled. "All the assets belong to me," he said also standing up.

 "I can watch, touch, and feel them as much as I want. And that doesn't make me a pervert." He said while 

Maledicta rolled her eyes and ran towards the bathroom. Kaiden's laughter followed her, and she couldn't help but smile.

As she showered, Maledicta couldn't help but think about the previous night. She felt a flutter in her chest as she remembered Kaiden's gentle touches and kisses.

She chuckled to herself, feeling a little silly. 

"Should I join you inside?" Kaiden's voice came from outside the bathroom door.

Maledicta smiled, "No," she muttered, trying to sound stern.

Kaiden groaned in disappointment, and Maledicta laughed.

As they walked into the dining hall, the whole student body started murmuring. They were surprised to see Maledicta smiling, and it was as if they were dreaming.

The students watched in awe as Kaiden and Maledicta sat at a corner, whispering to each other and laughing. They even fed each other, and the whole atmosphere felt like a dream.

"Something is different about them," Lilith said, watching curiously from her seat.

"I think they're glowing too," Belladonna said. "Isn't that strange?"

"Their mood too," Thane said, smiling. "They didn't even care that we're watching."

"I think something happened between them," Cassius said, smirking. "Something really good."

"I can feel it too," Thane said. "The rain last night too."

Belladonna and Lilith sighed, staring at Kaiden and Maledicta with dreamy eyes. 

"This is so wonderful," they said in unison. "We're jealous."

The guys looked at them weirdly and laughed. Benedicta was glaring at Kaiden and Maledicta with folded fists. She was almost losing it.

Her head suddenly fell onto the table, and she had a vision of Kaiden and Maledicta. She could see what they were doing the previous night, the rain, the storm.

Benedicta was already bleeding from her nose by the time she looked up. She always bled anytime she saw a past that included Maledicta.

"Are you okay?" Thane and Cassius asked in unison.

Benedicta didn't respond and just stormed off. 

"What's wrong with her?" Thane asked, watching her go.

"Why do you care?" Belladonna scoffed, rolling her eyes.

As Benedicta walked away, she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. She had seen something that she couldn't unsee, and it was going to change everything.

Meanwhile, Kaiden and Maledicta were still lost in their own little world. They were too caught up in each other to notice the commotion around them.

As they finished their breakfast, Kaiden leaned in and whispered, "I love you."

Maledicta's heart skipped a beat, and she smiled. "I love you too."

The whole dining hall erupted into cheers and applause, but Kaiden and Maledicta just laughed and kissed each other.

   “What is that” Ryder said in surprise while shaking his head.

     “I am just glad she is finally happy” Arachne smile too.
.
.
.
.
Ryder watched Kaiden with a mixture of confusion and amusement as they walked to the training ground. Kaiden couldn't stop grinning, and Ryder couldn't help but wonder what was behind that goofy smile.

"What's wrong with you?" Ryder asked, raising an eyebrow.

Kaiden's grin only grew wider. "Nothing, I just feel lucky," he said.

Ryder scoffed, shaking his head. "Wow, you're really something else."

Kaiden's expression turned serious, and he looked at Ryder with concern. "What's wrong with you, though? You look really dull these days. Is it because of Aka's death? I know you liked her." He said.

Ryder's expression turned somber, and he looked away, trying to hide his emotions. "It's nothing," he muttered.

But Kaiden wasn't having it. "No, really, what's wrong?" he pressed.

"I just keep wondering...what you think of Maledicta," Ryder said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Kaiden's face lit up with a bright smile. "She's my lucky charm, my happiness, the love of my life," he said, his eyes shining with adoration.

Ryder rolled his eyes,  "I guess I'm asking the wrong person that question," he said with a scoffed and started leaving.

   “Wait for me” Kaiden said while running after him.

As they approached the training ground, they saw all the male students gathered in one place.

What's going on?" he asked, pushing his way through the crowd.

One of the students turned to him with a wide grin. "Senior Benedicta decided to teach the male students today, isn't that amazing?" he said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise, and he looked around, trying to spot Benedicta. A few minutes later, she arrived, looking stunning in her training gear. She flashed them a bright smile, and the boys all grinned foolishly, trying to impress her.

Benedicta brought a challenge that made it difficult for them to complete with their clothes on, so they all took off their shirts. Benedicta walked around them, studying their backs as they took off their shirts. The boys all grinned, trying to show off their bodies to her.

But Benedicta's eyes were scanning the crowd, searching for someone. And then, she spotted Kaiden at the corner, his clothes still on. 

“Why are you still clothed?" she asked.

Kaiden looked around, feeling a little self-conscious. 

“I don't think I should do it, since I have a senior who trains me separately," he said, trying to sound nonchalant.

Benedicta's smile never wavered. "Take it off and join the others," she muttered, her eyes fixed on Kaiden's back.

Kaiden nodded, looking around nervously. He saw Maledicta but she was busy. He took a deep breath and slowly took off his shirt.

Benedicta's face lit up with excitement as she saw the mark on Kaiden's back. She had finally confirmed that he was the one she was looking for. She grinned, taking a step closer to Kaiden.

But just as she was about to reach him, someone grabbed Kaiden's arm, pulling him away.

 "I'm his personal trainer and I need him," Thane said.

Benedicta's smile faltered, and she looked at Thane with a mixture of anger and frustration. But she quickly regained her composure, flashing Thane a bright smile.

 "Of course," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness.

Kaiden looked at Thane, confused.

"Let's go, I only have the right to tell you what to do" he said, pulling Kaiden away.

Benedicta watched them leave, her eyes narrowing in frustration. She turned to the other students who were still grining at her.

"I'm no longer interested," she said, her voice cold.

The students all looked at each other in confusion, but Benedicta just turned and walked away, leaving them all staring after her.

Belladonna watched Benedicta leave, her eyes narrowed in suspicion. "She's definitely up to something," she muttered to herself. "But what?”
.
.
.

Lilith was engrossed in her book, sitting in the senior section of the library. The quiet atmosphere and musty smell of old books were her sanctuary. She was so absorbed in her reading that she didn't notice Thane's arrival until he stopped in front of her, his eyes fixed on her.

Lilith looked up, startled, and their eyes met for a brief moment. But Thane quickly turned away, his expression unreadable. Lilith's heart sank.

"Are we going to be like this now?" Lilith asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane stopped in his tracks, his back still turned to her. For a moment, Lilith thought he wasn't going to respond. But then, he slowly turned around, his eyes locking onto hers.

"You're the one who started it," he said, his voice low and husky.

Lilith felt a surge of emotions,"Then is that why you're ignoring me?" she asked, her voice trembling. "Did you know how much my heart hurts?"

 "I just think about what you said that day, and I realized it's true," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I couldn't bear to see you sad when I finally find my mate. You know us wolves; we get too attached to our mates. When I saw how Cassius was behaving, I knew the mate bond is stronger than anything." He added gently.

Lilith felt tears pricking at the corners of her eyes. "Are you saying we should give up now?" she asked, her voice cracking.

Thane's eyes locked onto hers, filled with a deep regret. "I think that's the best option, Lilith. I don't want you to be sad when you see me with another girl." He said.

Lilith felt a wave of anger wash over her. "What about now?" she snapped, her voice rising. "Aren't I sad already?"

Thane took a step closer to her, his eyes filled with a deep longing. "You have to understand me," he said gently.

But Lilith was beyond reason. "I have nothing to understand," she said, her voice cold. "You can have the library all to yourself."

With that, she stormed out of the library, leaving Thane standing alone, his eyes fixed on the empty space where Lilith had been.

Thane groaned, running his hands through his hair in frustration. "All this is driving me crazy," he muttered to himself.

Meanwhile, Lilith was almost in tears, but she quickly composed herself when she saw Belladonna approaching.

"Are you okay?" Belladonna asked, concern etched on her face.

Lilith forced a smile. "Yes."

Belladonna's eyes narrowed. "You can create image from what a person do and make people see it, right?" she asked.

Lilith raised an eyebrow. "Yeah, why did you ask that?"

Belladonna's smile was mischievous. "You'll find out. I really need your favor with something urgent."

Before Lilith could protest, Belladonna dragged her away, leaving Lilith wondering what she had just gotten herself into.
.
.
.

Benedicta arrived at the coven, her presence commanding attention. The demons bowed at her.

Benedicta smirked, her eyes flashing with amusement. She walked through the crowded hall, her long strides eating up the distance. She finally arrived in front of the queen, who sat on her throne, her eyes fixed intently on Benedicta.

"You're here with good news, right?" Queen Epusa asked, her voice dripping with coldness.

Benedicta nodded, a sly smile spreading across her face. "Yes, Queen. I found him, and he's someone closer to me than I expected. I can bring him easily." She said.

Queen Epusa's eyes lit up with excitement. "Then where is he?" she asked, her voice tinged with impatience.

Benedicta's smile faltered, and she hesitated before speaking. "There's still a problem, Your Majesty. She's closer to my sister than I expected, and I think something intimate might have happened between them." She said.

Queen Epusa's face turned pale, and she looked like she was about to faint.

 "What? How could you allow that to happen? This could ruin everything I've been working for all these years!" she exclaimed, her voice rising in panic.

Benedicta took a step back, her eyes widening in surprise. "I didn't know. I swear I didn't know." She said.

Queen Epusa's eyes flashed with anger. "You must bring him here before the three days of their mating are over. After the third day, they will connect, and Lucan will remain a powerless human for the rest of his life. That cannot happen." Epusa said.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Why will that happen?" she asked.

"Because they are mates, Benedicta. They are made for each other. They are made to destroy each other, to ruin each other, and they can also heal and bring peace to each other. But we cannot let the latter happen. The boy must be here soon to fulfill the main reason he was born." Queen Epusa said.

Benedicta's eyes widened in understanding, and she nodded. "I will make sure that doesn't happen. I will bring him here today, and to do that, I need to distract my sister first. And I know exactly what to do." She smirk.

A wicked smirk spread across Benedicta's face, and Queen Epusa's eyes gleamed with approval. 

"I will be looking forward to that. But just know that if you fail to bring him, you won't be able to achieve your aims."  Epusa said.

Benedicta nodded, "I won't fail, Your Majesty. I promise." She said.

With that, Benedicta turned and left the throne room.
.
.
.
.
Benedicta arrived at a corner of the school, a sly smile spreading across her face as she watched the students walking around. This was the perfect time to execute her plan.

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and began to chant some words under her breath. The air around her seemed to grow thick with anticipation, and she chuckled to herself as the black magic book appeared in her hand.

She had allowed Maledicta to take the book that day, but she knew she could take it back whenever she wanted. The book was bound to her, and she was its true master.

Benedicta opened the book to a particular page, her eyes scanning the dark magic spells written on it. She smiled to herself as she remembered the first time she had used this spell on Maledicta. It was the night she had killed Amaya, Maledicta's one and only friend.

The memory sent a shiver down Benedicta's spine, and she began to chant the words of the spell. Her eyes closed, and a dark, noisy energy began to build around her.

A creature emerged from the book, its presence like a dark storm cloud. It was ugly and twisted, with razor-sharp claws and teeth. Benedicta's eyes snapped open, and she watched with satisfaction as the creature disappeared into the crowd.

Maledicta had just come out of her room, feeling a sense of unease. She felt something behind her, but as she turned to look, the creature possessed her, taking control of her body.

Maledicta's eyes turned bright red, and her nails grew longer, sharper. She began to attack the people around her, her movements wild and unpredictable.

The students screamed and ran, trying to get away from her. But Maledicta didn't seem to recognize anyone, her eyes empty of any emotion.

The seniors arrived soon, trying to subdue Maledicta. But she was too strong, and she threw them off easily. Some of them got wounded, and Benedicta smiled in satisfaction as she watched the chaos unfold.

She joined the fight, using her own magic to try and subdue Maledicta. But Maledicta was too powerful, and she fought back with all her might.

Kaiden arrived on the scene, his eyes widening in shock as he took in the chaos. He wanted to join the fight, to help Maledicta, but some of the juniors held him back.

"You can't face her now," one of them said. "She's not in her right sense."

A senior threw a burning rope at Maledicta, trying to tie her down. But she cut the rope easily, her eyes blazing with fury.

She started approaching the senior, her long nails reaching out to strike. But just as she was about to attack, Kaiden shouted her name loudly.

Maledicta's hand hung in the air, and she seemed to struggle to control herself. Slowly, she came back to her senses, her eyes returning to normal.

She looked around, taking in the chaos and destruction. Her eyes widened in horror as she realized what she had done.

Maledicta's hand dropped to her side, and she took a step back, her eyes filled with fear. And then, she fell to the ground, losing consciousness.

The students cheered, relieved that the fight was over. But Kaiden just knelt beside Maledicta, his eyes filled with worry and concern.

The students stared at Maledicta's body, still feeling terrified. Mistress Morwen wasn't in school, so they didn't even know what to say.

"She's okay now," Kaiden said.

But Benedicta shook her head. "We can't conclude that she's okay. She hurt a lot of people, so she could still be a threat." She said.

Thane frowned. "What are you trying to say?" He asked.

Benedicta's expression turned serious. "I think it's better to lock her up for some days and check her health." She said.

But Cassius disagreed. "She's okay. Kaiden's been with her the whole time." He said.

Benedicta turned to the students. "But she can be dangerous to the students, right?"

The students all nodded in agreement, still looking scared. Four male students pushed Kaiden away and carried Maledicta's unconscious body.

But just as they were about to leave, Belladonna stood in their way.

 "What right do you have to make that judgment?" she asked angrily.

Benedicta's expression turned smug.

 "I'm just doing the right thing. I'm sure my mom would do the same thing if she were here." She said.

 "She wouldn't."Lilith said.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger. 

"You don't know what you're talking about. She is a threat" She said.

But Belladonna stood her ground. "We know exactly what we're talking about. You're the one who's been acting suspiciously and the real threat too”Belladonna said.

The students all looked at Belladonna in surprise, but she continued.

 "We've been watching you, Benedicta. We know what you've been up to." She said.

Lilith nodded. "We followed you to the demon coven this morning."

The students all gasped as Lilith made an image appear in the air. It was Benedicta, standing in front of a group of demons, who were all bowing to her.

Benedicta's eyes widened in shock, but Belladonna continued.

 "We didn't know what you did inside the coven, but we waited until you came back and continued following you."

Lilith made another image appear. This time, it was Benedicta, chanting black magic and summoning an evil spirit.

The students all looked at Benedicta in horror, and even Kaiden looked shocked.

Belladonna's voice was cold. "You called out an evil beast and made it possess Maledicta, so that she would look like a bad person when you're the truly evil one." She said angrily.

Benedicta's face turned red with anger, but she was too stunned to talk. She hadn't expected this at all.

"It's a lie!" she shouted, moving back slowly. "Don't believe them!"

But the students weren't buying it. They looked at her with suspicion, and even Thane and Cassius looked unsure.

Lilith's voice was calm. "We have proof. Whatever I show you is always the truth., I can't that type of image myself" she said.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger and she wanted to attack the Lilith and the black magic book fell from her body. Shw was too happy that time and didnt hide it.

The students mummers in shock whille staring at the book, she knew she was beaten. She turned and ran, disappearing into the crowd.

Benedicta sprang up from the bed, her eyes wide with surprise, as she saw Mistress Morwen standing in her room. She had locked her door, but Mistress Morwen had appear inside.

"Is it really true?" Mistress Morwen yelled, her voice echoing off the walls. "Did you do that to your sister?"

Benedicta's expression was calm, but her eyes flashed with anger.

 "It's true," she muttered plainly, not even bothering to deny it.

Mistress Morwen's face turned red with rage, and she slapped Benedicta hard across the face.

 "How could you?" she shouted, her voice trembling with anger.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed, and she rubbed her cheek, which was starting to swell. 

"Even till now, you still care about her more than me," she said angrily, her voice rising.

Mistress Morwen's expression turned incredulous. 

"What are you talking about? Did you know what you just did to your sister? And the worst part is that you're practicing black magic!" She yelled.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger, and she took a step closer to Mistress Morwen.

 "I did all that because of you, Mom," she spat.

 "It's your fault. You always cared about her more than me. You saw how she started taking everything from me - my spot, my man, my life - and what did you do? Nothing. Instead, you're grinning, happy, not caring about me." She added bitterly.

Mistress Morwen's face turned pale, and she looked like she had been slapped. 

"Benedicta, I..." she started, but Benedicta cut her off.

"You know I love you both and I want you to be happy," Mistress Morwen said, trying to reason with Benedicta.

 "I didn't know Maledicta took everything from you, and I'm sure she didn't." She said.

Benedicta's laughter was cold and mirthless. 

"Wow, you really trust her, don't you? Now I'm sure I'm not your daughter. I should have just killed her when I had the chance, because now all my plans to get rid of her have failed." Benedicta said senselessly.

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened in horror. 

"Don't tell me you've been trying to kill her," she whispered.

Benedicta's smile, "Of course, Mom. I've tried a lot of ways. I poisoned her with Fire Flame poison, I even used the black stone trick on her. Can you believe she still managed to survive?" She scoffed.

Mistress Morwen's face turned white, and she looked like she was about to faint. She wanted to slap her but Benedicta caught her hand.

"You're just like your father," she whispered, her voice trembling with anger.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger, and she took a step closer to Mistress Morwen.

 "I won't allow you to touch me again,I'll leave your school and go to a better school." She said and throw her hand off.

Mistress Morwen's eyes narrowed. "By better place, you mean the demon coven? That's not a better place for someone. They use you and dump you when you're useless." Mistress Morwen said.

Benedicta's laughter was cold. "At least they're still better than you, Mom." She said.

With that, Benedicta vanished into thin air, leaving Mistress Morwen standing alone in the room.

Mistress Morwen's face was etched with sadness and worry.

 "I really tried so much for you not to get involved with the demons, but I guess your demon side won't listen," she muttered to herself before leaving the room.

As she walked out of the room, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she had lost her daughter to the darkness.
.
.
.

Mistress Morwen rushed into the physician's room, her face etched with worry. 

"She was lying unconscious in this room just a few minutes ago," the old physician said, her eyes wide with concern.

 "I quickly went to get some herbs in the other room, but by the time I returned, she was gone." She added.

Mistress Morwen's eyes scanned the room, as if hoping to find Maledicta hiding in a corner. 

"Don't worry, she must have gone to her room," she said, trying to sound calm. She quickly left the physician's room and made her way to Maledicta's quarters.

When she arrived, she found Kaiden and Belladonna pacing back and forth in front of Maledicta's door. 

"What's going on?" Mistress Morwen asked, her eyes narrowing with concern.

Kaiden and Belladonna bowed to her before explaining the situation.

 "I tried to enter her room, but it was locked," Belladonna said.

 "I even used my powers to try and open it, but it's still not working." She added.

Mistress Morwen tried to enter the room, but a strange force pushed her back. She stumbled, but Belladonna and Kaiden quickly caught her, holding her steady.

"Maledicta, it's your mother," Mistress Morwen called out, trying to reason with her daughter. "Open the door."

But there was no response. Kaiden tried calling out to her as well, but the silence was deafening.

"She must want to be alone for now," Mistress Morwen said, her voice tinged with sadness. 

"Maybe we should come back later." She muttered some minutes later.

 "We can't leave her alone now," Kaiden said, his eyes filled with worry. "She really needs us."

Belladonna placed a hand on Kaiden's shoulder.

 "I understand how you feel, but Maledicta can be very stubborn. We have to wait until she calms down." Belladonna said.

Just then, Arachne appeared, looking curious. "What's wrong with big sister?" she asked, looking up at Mistress Morwen.

Belladonna's eyes widened in surprise. "She lets you call her that?"

Arachne nodded proudly. "Yes."

Mistress Morwen smiled. "Nothing's wrong, dear. She just wants to be alone for now. We should come back a few hours later." She said.

Arachne nodded, and the group began to disperse. But Kaiden refused to leave. 

"I'll continue to stay here until she decides to open the door," he said stubbornly.

Mistress Morwen's eyes filled with concern. "That might take longer than you expected." She said.

"I don't care."Kaiden shrugged.

Belladonna rolled her eyes. "Wow, he's just so stubborn just like her” she said.

As the group left, Kaiden sat down at the doorstep, his eyes fixed on the door. 

"Maledicta, it's me, your pill," he said, his voice low and soothing. "You shouldn't be in there alone without me."

But there was no response. Kaiden sighed sadly, his eyes never leaving the door. He was ready to wait for Maledicta, no matter how long it took.
.
.
.
.

Maledicta was crying uncontrollably, her body shaking with sobs. She couldn't shake off the memories of the previous day's events. The images of her hands covered in blood, her fingers sharp and bloodied, and the seniors and students groaning in pain were etched in her mind like a nightmare.

She remembered the look of horror on the senior's face as she was about to kill him. The sound of her own screams still echoed in her mind. She had never felt so out of control, so consumed by a dark force that seemed to take over her body.

The memories of Amaya flooded her mind, and she felt a fresh wave of tears. She remembered the night Amaya came to spend the night with her. They had been having so much fun, laughing and joking around. But then, something had changed. Maledicta had started to feel weird, and when she woke up, Amaya was dead.

The image of Amaya's lifeless body, covered in scratches and blood, was forever etched in Maledicta's mind. She had never forgiven herself for not being able to protect her friend.

As she cried, Maledicta couldn't shake off the feeling that she was responsible for Amaya's death. The thought sent a chill down her spine. Was she truly capable of such evil?

The tears streaming down her face seemed to wash away her doubts, replacing them with a deep-seated fear. She was a monster, a beast that didn't deserve to be among people.

Kaiden's voice outside her door was a distant echo, but it only made her cry harder. She didn't want to see him, didn't want to risk hurting him. She was too dangerous, too unpredictable.

"Maledicta, please open the door," Kaiden's voice pleaded. "What happened wasn't your fault. Please just let me in, I'll explain everything." He said.

But Maledicta covered her ears, blocking out his words. She couldn't listen to him, couldn't risk being swayed by his kindness. She was a monster, and monsters didn't deserve love or compassion.

As Kaiden's voice continued to echo outside her door, Maledicta's resolve began to waver. She felt a pang of longing, a desire to see Kaiden's face, to hear his voice. But she pushed the feeling aside, reminding herself of the danger she posed.

She moved towards the door, her hand reaching for the handle. But she stopped herself just in time. No, she wouldn't do that. She wouldn't risk hurting Kaiden.

Maledicta went back to her bed, blocking out Kaiden's voice and the sound of his footsteps outside her door. She couldn't hear anything from the outside anymore, and for that, she was grateful.

"This is the best thing to do," she muttered to herself, trying to convince herself that she was making the right decision.

But as she lay in bed, surrounded by the darkness of her own fears, Maledicta couldn't shake off the feeling that she was running from the truth. That she was hiding from the one person who might be able to help her uncover the secrets of her past.

As the tears dried on her cheeks, Maledicta felt a sense of emptiness wash over her. She was alone, and she didn't know how to escape the darkness that seemed to be closing in around her.

Benedicta entered the coven, her eyes fixed on the ground. She was feeling a little nervous, her hands trembling slightly as she clasped them together.

Queen Epusa looked up from her throne, her eyes narrowing as she took in Benedicta's empty-handed appearance. 

"Why are you here empty-handed?" she asked, her voice cold and menacing. "I thought you promised to bring him yesterday."

Benedicta swallowed hard, trying to explain. "I'm so sorry, my plan failed again. And now I couldn't even go to school because everyone knows I came here to see you. I'm just grateful they didn't know why I came here, because my mom is also looking for Lucan." She said.

Epusa's expression turned alarmed. "Why is your mom looking for him?" she asked, her voice rising.

Benedicta hesitated before answering. "Because she figured out that he didn't die. Now they want to kill him before he gets his powers back." She said.

Epusa's face turned pale, and she looked like she was about to faint. 

"Now this is more dangerous," she muttered.

 "Are you giving up because they've found out about you?" She asked after some minute.

Benedicta shook her head, determination etched on her face. "Who says I'm giving up? I'll take on my invisible form and check the school. I'll bring Lucan here, I promise."

Epusa raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. "How can I trust you? You've said that more than twice, but I haven't seen him here." She said.

Benedicta's eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her cool.

 "Mark my word, if I don't come here without him, you have the right to do whatever you want with me. But if I bring him here, you're still going to follow our deal." She said.

Epusa's expression turned cold, and she nodded. "I will." She muttered.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed. "Don't go back on your word." She said.

With that, she vanished into thin air, leaving Epusa alone in the coven.

Epusa burst into laughter, her eyes gleaming with amusement.

 "Her cruel fate has started manifesting," she said, her voice dripping with malice. "I see a little of her father in her, which is good."

She leaned back in her throne, a calculating look on her face.

 "Benedicta thinks she's in control, but she has no idea what's coming. Her fate is already sealed, and soon she'll be nothing but a pawn in my game." She thought.

Epusa's laughter echoed through the coven, sending shivers down the spines of the demons who were watching from the shadows. They knew that when Epusa laughed like that, it was never a good sign.

"What are you still doing here? It's late already," Ryder said, standing beside Kaiden, who hadn't moved or left the spot since he arrived.

"She will soon open the door, I'm sure of it," Kaiden said, his smile weak but determined.

Ryder sighed. "Kaiden, you haven't eaten since morning. You should eat something." He said.

Kaiden looked up, and Ryder handed him a big red apple. Kaiden took it quickly and started munching on it hungrily.

"Look at you, you shouldn't suffer yourself," Ryder said, shaking his head. "I know by tomorrow, she'll come around."

Kaiden stopped eating the apple, his expression turning sad.

"What's wrong?" Ryder asked.

"What if she hasn't eaten anything too?" Kaiden said, his voice filled with concern.

Ryder rolled his eyes. "You're so pathetic." He muttered.

Just then, Maledicta suddenly appeared, and a bright smile covered Kaiden's face. He sprang up and went to hug her tightly.

"I missed you so much," he said happily.

Maledicta smiled back, looking a bit nervous.

 "I'm sorry for ignoring you. Can we go somewhere?" She asked.

Kaiden nodded eagerly, still holding her tightly.

"He didn't even bid me farewell."Ryder scoffed.

As Kaiden and Maledicta walked away, hand in hand, Ryder shook his head and left.

The forest was quiet, the only sound being the rustling of leaves beneath their feet. Kaiden looked at Maledicta, his eyes shining with happiness.

"I'm glad you're okay," he said, squeezing her hand.

Maledicta smiled back, her eyes sparkling. "I'm sorry again for ignoring you. I just needed some time alone." She said.

Kaiden nodded understandingly. "I know. I'm just glad you're back."

As they walked deeper into the forest, Maledicta suddenly turned onto a narrower path.

"Where are we going?" Kaiden asked, looking around. "I thought we were going to the lake."

Maledicta's smile turned nervous. "Not the lake. I have something special to show you."

Kaiden's eyes lit up. "Have you built our special place?" he asked, his voice filled with excitement.

Maledicta nodded, her smile growing. "Um, yes."

Kaiden's face lit up. "I can't wait to see it."

He walked ahead, pulling Maledicta along. She smiled weridly.
.
.
.
.

Ryder was about to take off his clothes when he heard a knock at the door. He went to open it, and his eyes widened in surprise when he saw Maledicta standing in the hallway. She looked pale and tired, her eyes sunken with dark circles.

"Senior," Ryder called gently, concern etched on his face.

Maledicta's eyes seemed to flutter, and she leaned against the doorframe for support.

 "Is Kaiden here? I checked his room, and he wasn't there."

Ryder's expression turned puzzled. 

"What? He left with you a few minutes ago." He said in confusion.

Maledicta's eyes widened in shock, and she took a step back, as if she had been punched in the gut. 

"I haven't come out of my room since morning." She said.

Ryder's face turned white, and he yelled, "That wasn't you, then who is it?"

Maledicta's eyes filled with panic, and she grabbed Ryder's arm.

 "Where did they go?" She asked.

 "The forest." He muttered.

Without another word, they both took off, running into the forest as fast as they could.

Meanwhile, Kaiden suddenly stopped walking and stared at the person beside him. It was Maledicta, or so he thought.

"Why haven't you asked about what happened last night after you collapsed?" he asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.

The person beside him smirked. "Asked about what? I know what happened already." She said.

Kaiden's eyes widened in surprise. "How? You're not my Maledicta." He said.

The person beside him laughed, a cold, mirthless sound, and suddenly transformed into Benedicta.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock, and he took a step back.

Benedicta smirked, her eyes gleaming with malice. "You're a bit smarter than I thought." She said.

Kaiden's face turned cold, and he asked, "What did you want from me?"

Benedicta's smirk grew wider. "Your love, your attention. I'll do anything to have that." She said.

Kaiden's expression turned disgusted. "I'll never look at you, no matter what. You won't be getting what you want from me. Stay away from Maledicta too, because I'll never forgive you if you do something to her again." He said and started leaving.

Benedicta's face turned red with rage, and she suddenly stabbed Kaiden in the neck with a pin.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock and he quickly turn back to her, and he tried to speak, but his voice was slurred. "What...what..."

That was all he got to say before falling to the ground,weakly.

Benedicta started dragging him away, her eyes gleaming with malice.

As she dragged Kaiden deeper into the forest, Maledicta, Ryder, and Belladonna's voices echoed through the trees, calling out Kaiden's name.

"Kaiden!" "Kaiden!!" "Kaiden!!!"

But Kaiden couldn't respond, couldn't even move. He was trapped in a darkness that seemed to have no end.

                (LUCAN)

All the seniors gathered at the designated meeting spot, their faces etched with worry and concern. They were all breathing heavily, as if they had been searching for Kaiden for hours.

Maledicta arrived a few minutes later, looking weaker than before. Her eyes were sunken, and her skin was pale.

"Is he found?" she asked impatiently, her heart racing with anxiety.

The seniors shook their heads in unison. "We can't find him," they chorused.

Maledicta's face fell, and she looked like she was about to collapse. Cassius stepped forward, his expression grim.

"I don't think he's still inside the school," he said. "The intruder must have taken him somewhere."

 "Then what are we waiting for? We should look for him."Maledicta said boldly.

She started to leave, but Mistress Morwen appeared out of nowhere, her face stern.

"No one can go outside the school," she said firmly. "It's really dangerous."

Maledicta's face turned red with anger. "Are you saying we should just allow him to die? We don't even know what's happening to him now." She asked.

Mistress Morwen's expression softened, but her voice remained firm. "Maledicta, please understand me. That side is too dangerous for us. We don't even know what's going on there. You may die, and so may the others." She said.

Maledicta's jaw clenched in defiance. "I don't care." She snapped.

She was about to move again when suddenly, everything went dark. The seniors gasped in shock, and some of them stumbled backward.

"What's wrong?" they whispered among themselves, fear creeping into their voices.

The loud thunderstorms started immediately, and they hit Maledicta with incredible force. She was thrown against a tree, and the seniors gasped in horror.

Maledicta groaned in pain as the thunder struck her again and again. She tried to escape, but she couldn't even move an inch.

Mistress Morwen ran to her, but a huge force threw her off. Her back hit a tree, and the tree broke into two. She lost consciousness immediately.

The seniors combined their powers and tried to stop the storm, but they were all thrown in different directions. Most of them couldn't stand up anymore.

"Why is this happening?" Belladonna asked weakly, watching in horror as Maledicta continued to get struck by the thunder.

Mistress Morwen was still unconscious, and the seniors were powerless to stop the storm. It was as if the heavens themselves were angry with Maledicta for some unknown reason.

The storm raged on, its fury unabated. Maledicta's body was battered and bruised, but she refused to give up. She was determined to find Kaiden, no matter what the cost.

As the storm continued to rage, the seniors could only watch in horror, powerless to stop the destruction. They knew that Maledicta was strong, but they also knew that she wasn't invincible.
.
.
.
.

Benedicta's smirk grew wider as she dragged the unconscious Kaiden into the coven. Queen Epusa sprang up from her throne, her eyes fixed curiously on Kaiden's limp form.

"Is this really him?" Epusa asked, her voice dripping with excitement.

Benedicta nodded, a triumphant glint in her eye. "You can check that out yourself." He said.

She moved closer to Kaiden, gently tearing his clothes at the back. A cruel smile spread across her face as she revealed the mark on his back.

Epusa's laughter echoed throughout the coven, a cold, mirthless sound.

 "You did just as you promised." She muttered.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment, her eyes narrowing slightly.

 "So, what are we going to do now? Maledicta may come here." She asked.

Epusa's expression turned dismissive. "She can never come here." She muttered.

With a flick of her wrist, the golden book appeared in front of Epusa. She opened a box, revealing a dagger materialized in her hand, and with a swift motion, she stabbed Kaiden directly in the heart.

Kaiden's eyes snapped open, and he gasped, his body jerking in response to the pain. But his eyes closed again, and he lay still.

Epusa's smile grew wider as she watched the blood flow from Kaiden's wound. She moved the dagger closer to the golden book, allowing the blood to drip onto the lock. At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then, the book open and  began to glow, a soft, golden light emanating from within.

The glow grew brighter, illuminating the dark recesses of the coven. Benedicta's eyes widened as she watched, mesmerized, as the book opened wide, revealing its secrets.

The golden glow enveloped Kaiden's body, and he began to breathe heavily. The mark on his back started to glow, and it moved, shifting from his back to his forehead.

Benedicta's eyes were fixed on Kaiden, her expression a mixture of awe and fear. She had never seen anything like this before.

As the glow faded, Kaiden lay still, his chest rising and falling with each breath. Benedicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions.

But before she could ask anything, Kaiden's eyes snapped open, and he sat up, his movements swift and fluid. His eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity, and Benedicta felt a shiver run down her spine.

Epusa, who had been watching with a satisfied smile, suddenly found herself flying across the room, slamming into the wall with a loud thud. An invisible rope wrapped around her, holding her in place.

Benedicta's eyes widened as she watched, frozen in shock. Kaiden's eyes seemed to bore into her soul, and she felt a wave of fear wash over her.

But before she could react, she found herself pinned to the wall, an invisible force holding her in place. Kaiden's eyes seemed to gleam with amusement as he stared at her.

"Who are you?" he asked, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down Benedicta's spine.

Benedicta swallowed hard, trying to find her voice. "I...I am your follower. I helped you recover your power, with her help” she muttered, she couldn't looking at him because he look more handsome, his air growing longer and a golden ring around his hair.

She pointed at Epusa, who was still groaning in pain, the invisible rope crushing her.

Kaiden's gaze shifted to Epusa, and he smiled, a cold, calculating smile. 

"It's good to be back." He muttered.

With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Benedicta and Epusa staring at each other in shock.

As they watched, the walls of the coven began to crumble, the sound of thunder echoing through the air. The storm outside seemed to be growing more intense, the wind howling like a pack of wolves.

Epusa's eyes gleamed with excitement as she stared at the destruction. "The heavens are really angry. Someone powerful is awake." She said.

She smiled, a cold, calculating smile, and stood up, brushing off her robes.
.
.
.
.

The seniors let out a collective sigh of relief as the rain and storm finally started to die down. They quickly rushed to Maledicta's body, which was lying under a tree. She was looking terrible, with huge scars covering her body. Belladonna started crying immediately, her eyes welling up with tears.

"Oh, Maledicta," she sobbed, falling to her knees beside her friend's body.

The others quickly joined her, gently lifting Maledicta's body and carrying her back to the school. Some of the seniors also carried Mistress Morwen's body, who was still unconscious.

As they approached the school, they saw that all the students were outside, looking confused and worried. Arachne rushed towards them, her eyes widening in shock when she saw Maledicta's body.

"What happened to my sister?" she asked, her voice trembling.

But the seniors were too busy to respond, quickly carrying Maledicta's body to the physician's room. The physician quickly got to work, using all sorts of herbs and potions to try and heal Maledicta's wounds.

As they left the physician's room, Lilith turned to the others, her eyes blazing with anger.

"What is all this?" she demanded. "I am so mad. What has she done to deserve such hard punishment from the goddess?"

Belladonna's eyes were also flashing with anger.

 "You can't talk to the goddess that way," Cassius warned. "You could get punished."

But Lilith and Belladonna just scoffed, walking ahead of the others.

The group went to the pool of students, who were still looking confused and worried.

"Nothing serious happened," Cassius reassured them. "Just go to your rooms, it's late. We'll talk tomorrow."

The students nodded, still looking worried, and started to disperse.

"What should we do now, since Mistress Morwen is also sick?" Thane asked.

Belladonna's eyes narrowed. "We should continue to look for Kaiden. Things will get worse if Maledicta wakes up and he's still missing." She said.

But as they tried to leave the school, they were shocked to find that a strong, invisible shield was blocking their way.

"What's going on?" Lilith demanded, trying to push through the shield.

But it was no use. The shield was too strong, and they were thrown back into the school.

"We can't find him," Belladonna groaned, frustration etched on her face. "What are we going to do now?"

 "Let's just wait till tomorrow. Things will have sorted themselves out, I'm sure.Cassius said.

The group reluctantly returned to the school, looking downcast.

As they gathered around Maledicta's bedside.

"You two should go to your rooms," Cassius said, nodding towards Lilith and Belladonna. "Thane and I will stay with them."

But Belladonna shook her head. "She's my friend, so I'm not leaving her side." She said and sit down.

Lilith nodded in agreement, sitting down beside Belladonna.

The guys leaned against the wall, watching the girls with concern.

Ryder couldn't sleep, his mind racing with worries about Kaiden. He kept pacing around his room, trying to think of what might be happening to his friend.

Just then, a butterfly flew into his room, and Ryder's eyes widened in surprise as it transformed into Arachne.

"I knew you wouldn't be sleeping," she said, smiling. "That's why I decided to see you."

Ryder shook his head, feeling a pang of guilt. "I just can't stop thinking about Kaiden."

Arachne's expression turned serious. "He's going to be okay."

Ryder looked at her skeptically. "How can you be so sure?"

Arachne's eyes sparkled. "I just am."

Ryder sighed, feeling a bit better. "I just think this whole thing is my fault."

"Don't blame yourself. You didn't do anything wrong." She said.

Arachne hugged him tightly, and Ryder felt a sense of comfort wash over him.
.

.
.

"How is the Nightshade?" Lucan asked with a smirk, his eyes gleaming with malevolence.

"They are doing well," Epusa replied, her voice dripping with malice. "I can't wait for you to rain your doom upon them."

Lucan's smile grew wider. "Those animals decided to kill me because I killed a mother who didn't deserve to be called one. She made me know what I am capable of doing because she couldn't stop rubbing it on my face. She hated me." He said.

He paused, his eyes flashing with anger.

"I killed her and the witnesses, and the whole town decided to burn me alive. My dad saved me from the fire, but why can't I remember what happened after that?" He muttered.

"I could help you with that."Benedicta spoke up quickly.

Lucan's glare was icy. "I will make sure to destroy the whole town, but first, I can't live in a place like this." He said.

With a wave of his hand, the demons' coven transformed into a perfect paradise. The walls turned to gold, and the floors became crystal. The air was filled with the sweet scent of roses, and the sound of gentle music echoed through the halls.

Lucan's throne glowed with an otherworldly light, and he looked around in satisfaction.

"My lord, you can't make this place this beautiful," Epusa said quickly. "We demons hate such things."

Lucan looked around at the demons, his expression disgusted.

"I don't need them," he muttered, and the demons started burning, including those standing outside.

"My lord, you can't do this!"Epusa yelled, but a force threw her against the wall.

The ground opened, and skeletons started coming out. As soon as they emerged, they gained skin and looked handsome.

"This is my undead army," Lucan said, his voice dripping with pride.

The skeletons bowed respectfully. "My lord." They chorus.

Epusa struggled to speak, blood pouring out of her mouth. "My lord…” She muttered.

  “My lord,there is someone...said to kill you."Benedicta quickly said.

 "Wow, that is amazing. I should meet them." Lucan said with a deadly smile.

"I can take you to her tomorrow," Benedicta said, her eyes gleaming with malice.

Lucan's interest was piqued. "I should see the ‘her’  I should see how capable she is." He said.

Epusa tried to speak again, "My lord, we should focus on their town first..." but gasped as a dagger entered her heart.

She looked at Benedicta in surprise, blood pouring out of her mouth. Lucan stare at the looking uninterested.

"She wanted to be a hindrance, so I took her out of the way first," Benedicta said, her voice cold.

Lucan smirked, as he moved away. He was more interested in the person said to kill him.

Epusa struggled to speak, her voice barely above a whisper. "You...will...regret...this."

Benedicta's smirk grew wider. "I doubt it."

Epusa's snakes wanted to attack Benedicta, but she killed them instantly.

Benedicta wanted to leave, but Epusa grabbed her arm and bit it. Benedicta gasped and stabbed Epusa again, this time in the forehead.

Epusa fell to the ground, and Benedicta watched with a smirk as she turned to ashes.

"It's finally my time," Benedicta whisper, her voice dripping with malice.

As the ashes disappeared, Benedicta turned to Lucan her beating loudly, she is going to make sure, he becomes hers.
.
.
.
            THE NEXT DAY   

Mistress Morwen stared at Maledicta's face as tears escaped her eyes.

 "I am so sorry, daughter. It's my fault. I should have told you," she said, her voice trembling with emotion.

Maledicta's eyes fluttered open, and she looked up at her mother weakly. 

"Told me what?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Mistress Morwen's face lit up with a happy smile. "You're awake!" she exclaimed.

Maledicta's gaze narrowed slightly. "What were you supposed to tell me?" she asked instead.

Mistress Morwen's expression turned somber, and she took a deep breath. 

"I'm sorry, darling. You're not cursed," she said.

Maledicta's eyes widened slightly, and she sat up, her gaze fixed intently on her mother. 

"What do you mean?" she asked.

Mistress Morwen's eyes filled with tears again.

 "You're not cursed, Maledicta. You're a blessing. You were sent to save us from the powerful demon lord Lucan. We didn't let you know because we killed him a long time ago," Mistress Morwen explained.

Maledicta's face turned pale, and she felt like she had been punched in the gut. 

"Why are you telling me now?" she asked angrily.

 "Because he's somehow alive, and I think he's got his powers back. That's why you were punished with thunder yesterday," Mistress Morwen said.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger, but she quickly composed herself.

 "I don't care about that now. What about Kaiden? Is he found now?" she asked, her voice laced with worry.

Mistress Morwen's face turned somber. "We couldn't find him. I think Lucan must have taken him," Mistress Morwen said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Just then, the loud murmuring of the students outside distracted them. 

"What's going on?" Mistress Morwen asked, and they both went out curiously.

As they stepped outside, they were greeted by a sea of students, all talking and gesturing wildly.

Lucan's expression was unreadable as he entered the school, his presence seeming to command attention. Benedicta walked beside him, a triumphant smile spreading across her face.

The students parted, their eyes fixed on Lucan in a mixture of shock and awe. They whispered among themselves, their voices barely audible.

"Is this Kaiden?" someone asked.

"He looks different," another student replied.

Maledicta stepped forward, her eyes widening as she took in Lucan's transformed appearance. Her face lit up with a happy smile, and she started running toward him, arms outstretched.

   “That is the girl that was said to kill you” Benedicta whisper to Lucan, he watch Maledicta running to him.

But as she was about to hug him, Lucan's expression changed. His eyes flashed with contempt, and he reached out, grabbing Maledicta's neck. 

His leg left the ground, and he hovered in mid-air, his grip tightening around Maledicta's throat.

The students gasped in shock, their eyes fixed on the scene unfolding before them.

"Is this weak thing supposed to kill me?" Lucan asked, his voice dripping with disdain. He smirked as he continued to strangle Maledicta.

"Is this weak thing supposed to kill me?" Lucan asked, his voice dripping with disdain. He smirked as he continued to strangle Maledicta.

Benedicta watched, her smile growing wider.

 "You're quite...impressive, my lord," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lucan's gaze flicked to Benedicta, his expression unreadable. But he didn't release his grip on Maledicta's neck.

The students watched in horror, unsure of what to do. Some of them took a step forward, but Lucan's gaze warned them off.

Maledicta's face was turning blue, her eyes bulging as she struggled to breathe. But Lucan just laughed, his eyes glinting with malevolence.

And then, just as suddenly as he had started, Lucan released Maledicta. She fell to the ground, gasping for air.

Lucan's gaze swept the students, his expression cold.

"Aren't you the one born to kill me?" Lucan asked, his voice dripping with coldness, as he took majestic steps towards Maledicta.

Maledicta struggled to get up from the ground, her eyes fixed on Lucan's face. 

"Kaiden, what has come over you?" she asked weakly.

Lucan's gaze flicked to Maledicta, his expression unreadable. 

"And who is that?" he asked, his voice laced with confusion.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger as she glared at Benedicta.

 "What did you do to him?" she demanded.

Benedicta smirked, her eyes gleaming with malice. 

"I did what was supposed to be done years ago," she said.

Maledicta's face twisted with rage as she launched herself at Benedicta, but some guards quickly intervened, protecting Benedicta.

"You demon, leave Kaiden's body right now!" Maledicta screamed, shaking Lucan's chest.

Lucan's smirk grew wider as he watched Maledicta's outburst. He suddenly released her hand from his shirt, and Maledicta fell to the ground.

Ryder rushed forward, his eyes filled with concern. 

"Kaiden, what came over you? Are you angry that we didn't find you on time? It's my fault, I should have sensed the intruder," Ryder said sadly.

Lucan stared at Ryder, his expression unreadable. He didn't say anything, but instead started approaching Maledicta, who was still on the ground.

He raised her chin, his fingers digging into her skin.

 "I won't be happy if I kill you like this," he said coldly.

 "At least we should have a fight. I should know how capable you are." He added.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with defiance, but Lucan's grip on her chin tightened.

Just then, Mistress Morwen flew towards Lucan, a dagger glinting in her hand.

 "Stay away from my daughter!" she yelled.

Lucan quickly moved away, but the dagger cut his cheek, leaving a thin trail of blood.

Mistress Morwen's eyes widened as she attacked Lucan again, but he caught her easily, his grip like a vice.

Mistress Morwen's eyes locked onto Lucan's face, and she gasped.

 "Kai...den... You are...Lucan?" she asked, her voice trembling.

Lucan's expression turned icy, and he threw Mistress Morwen against the wall. Her back hit the wall with a sickening thud, and she started vomiting blood.

The students drew their swords, their faces set in anger.

 "Take Mistress Morwen and the weak students to the hideout!" Cassius shouted.

Some seniors and students quickly obeyed, carrying Mistress Morwen and the weaker students away from the battle.

The remaining students fought valiantly, but the undead army seemed endless. No matter how many they cut down, the army just kept coming back.

"If you're getting weak, please go to the hideout now before it's late!" Belladonna shouted.

More students left, leaving only a handful of fighters. They fought bravely, but the army was too strong.

Just when it seemed like all was lost, Lucan suddenly ordered his army to stop. Benedicta frowned, but didn't say anything.

"Capture them all and follow me," Lucan said, his eyes locked onto Maledicta's face.

Maledicta glared at Lucan, her eyes flashing with defiance. But Lucan just smirked, his eyes glinting with amusement.

The students were quickly tied up and carried away, leaving the school in ruins. Lucan watched them go.

As they were dragged away, Maledicta caught a glimpse of Ryder's worried face. She tried to smile, but her lips felt frozen, she believed all these were just dream and when  she wake up everything will be back to normal.

The last thing she saw was Lucan's face, his eyes glinting with malevolence. And then everything went black.
.

.
.

They were all made to kneel down in front of Lucan, who was sitting majestically on his throne. Some of them were still in shock, unable to stop staring at Kaiden, who looked totally different from the person they once knew.

"We couldn't find the other students and their Mistress," one of the army reported.

"They can't be found," Benedicta chimed in, a sly smile spreading across her face.

"Take them all to the dungeon," Lucan said, his voice cold.

 "I have to set them as an example to the town people." He added.

"Kaiden, what's wrong with you? It's me, Ryder, your best friend. How can you forget Maledicta too?"Ryder yelled out in desperation as he was being taken away.

Maledicta followed weakly, still trying to process everything that was happening. It all felt like a dream to her, a never-ending nightmare.

"No, no, my lord, you can't spare them. They all deserve to be killed, especially the girl."Benedicta spoke up, her voice dripping with malice.

With a swift motion, Lucan was already strangling her, his eyes burning with fire. 

"Who gave you the right to make decisions and tell me what to do?" he asked coldly.

Benedicta struggled to speak, her voice barely above a whisper. "I am... sorry... my... lord. I won't try that again." She stammered.

Lucan's grip tightened, and Benedicta's face turned blue.

 "It shouldn't happen again, or I will kill you immediately," he warned, before releasing her.

She fell to the ground, gasping for air, and coughing violently.

The students were thrown into the dungeon, the heavy door slamming shut behind them. Thane started pacing around the small, dimly lit room.

"What's wrong with him?" Thane asked, his voice laced with frustration. "Can somebody explain to me?" He said.

Cassius shook his head. "You're not the only one, imagine that weak Kaiden suddenly becoming this... this monster." He muttered

Lilith looked worried. "What are we going to do now? We don't even know if Mistress and the other students are okay." She said.

 "They are, as far as they are in the hideout. No power can break it." Cassius said.

Belladonna turned to Maledicta, who was staring off into space.

 "Are you okay?" she asked gently.

Maledicta didn't respond, her eyes fixed on some distant point.

Arachne tried to get her attention. "Big sis, please talk to us." She said sadly.

Ryder looked down, his voice barely above a whisper.

 "All this is my fault. If I hadn't given Aka that book, this wouldn't have happened." He said.

Maledicta's gaze snapped back to Ryder.

 "What book?" she asked, her voice cold.

Ryder hesitated before speaking. "It's about you. I didn't read it, but my grandpa told me a little bit about Lucan. He's a demon whose power was locked. I should have known the moment I saw the mark on his back. I heard you're the one who's supposed to kill him."

The others gasped in shock, but Maledicta didn't say anything. Her fists were clenched in anger.

Why was her fate so cruel? Why was she destined to fight this monster, who is also the person she has ever loved? She didn't know why she is this helpless.
Soon they all fell asleep.
.
.
.

Benedicta entered Lucan's room, her eyes widening in awe at the sheer scale and beauty of the space. The room was huge, intricately carved walls.  It was hard to believe that this was the same demon coven they had been using before.

"You called for me," Benedicta said, her voice husky as she stared at Lucan's face.

Lucan's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze piercing. "You know all about me, right?" he asked.

Benedicta nodded, her smile growing wider. "Yes, my lord. I know everything about you."

"Then you must know why those students keep calling me Kaiden," Lucan said.

Benedicta bowed her head, her eyes cast downward. "You were once a student of that school, until I brought you here," she said.

Lucan's gaze snapped back to Benedicta's face. "That girl, what is my relationship with her?" he asked, his eyes glinting with interest.

Benedicta's smile grew wider, her eyes sparkling with malice. 

"She is a cursed evil girl, who made you see hell because you were just a weak human then. She bullied you, and I had to continue to save you from her. She almost killed you the day I brought you here, that's why I said she deserves to be killed immediately." She lied.

Lucan's expression was unreadable, but Benedicta could sense a flicker of doubt in his eyes.

"What about the boy who talked about being friends?" Lucan asked, his voice cold.

Benedicta's smile grew wider. "He is no friend, he just pretended to be close to you and mocked you behind your back. The whole school hated you because you were weak." She said.

Lucan's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze piercing. "So they are both interesting," he muttered coldly.

"I was the only one by your side, I didn't listen to them and continued to protect you," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness.

Lucan's gaze flicked to Benedicta's face.

 "You can leave," he muttered.

Benedicta's smile grew wider, her eyes seductive, as she stare at his face.

"I could make you feel good, my lord, if you will let me," she said, her voice husky as she touched his chest.

But Lucan didn't even flinch, his mind elsewhere.

 "Leave, I will call you when I need you," he said, his voice cold.

Benedicta's smile faltered for a moment, before she quickly regained her composure. She bowed her head, her eyes cast downward. 

"Yes, my lord," she said, before turning and leaving the room.

As soon as she was outside, Benedicta's smile dropped, her eyes blazing with anger.

 "The fool still won't notice me," she muttered to herself, her fists clenched in frustration.

Lucan, meanwhile, couldn't shake off the memory of Maledicta and Ryder's eyes as they stared at him. They didn't look like people who would hurt him. In fact, they looked like they genuinely cared about him.

He frowned, his mind racing with questions. Who was he, really? What was his past? And what was the truth about Maledicta and Ryder?
.

Mistress Morwen appeared in the town, her presence commanding attention. She made her way to the town hall, where the elders were already gathered with the king.

The king's face was etched with worry as he turned to Mistress Morwen. 

"We saw the sign in the sky. Tell me it's not true," he said, his voice laced with desperation.
"I am afraid it is, your highness," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"How could you allow something like that to happen? You know he will ruin us!"One of the elders yelled, his face red with anger.

Mistress Morwen bowed her head, her eyes downcast. "I am sorry for my carelessness," she apologized.

"Where is your daughter? We should prepare her for the task ahead. You have the golden dagger, right?" The king asked.

Mistress Morwen's face twisted with worry. "He has her, my king. He found out that she was the child destined to kill him," she said, her voice trembling.

The elders erupted into a cacophony of angry voices, each one demanding to know how this had happened.

"How did this happen? We didn't let the news go out to the people, so how did he find out?" one of the elders yelled.

Mistress Morwen shook her head. "I don't know, my lord. I have been trying to figure that out myself," she said.

 "I hope you told her about her destiny. Find a way to give her the dagger. She must kill that beast, or we will all be dead instead," The king said.

Mistress Morwen nodded. "I tried to go near his coven, but it was protected. But I will try all I can," she said.

The king's expression turned concerned. "What about the students? Are they okay?" he asked.

Mistress Morwen's face twisted with worry. "He captured a few, but the others are okay," she said.

The king nodded. "Bring those ones to the town. I think it will be better to protect them here," he said.

Mistress Morwen bowed her head. "Yes, my lord," she said before she vanished.

The elders started talking among themselves, their voices hushed but urgent. But the king was quiet, his eyes fixed on some distant point.

He hoped his children were safe. He can't bare to lose them.
.

Benedicta stepped out of her room, surprised to see the bustling activity in the coven. The captured students were already busy working, their faces etched with exhaustion and fear.

She spotted Arachne approaching and stood in her way, a sly smile spreading across her face. "What's going on?" she asked, her voice dripping with curiosity.

Arachne's eyes flashed with anger. "I hope you're happy, since we've finally become your maids," she spat.

Benedicta scoffed, her expression twisting with disdain. "That isn't what I'm asking you," she said, her voice cold.

Arachne's gaze faltered, and she tried to step around Benedicta. But Benedicta was too quick, grabbing Arachne's neck and starting to strangle her.

"Tell me now, or you die," Benedicta hissed, her eyes blazing with fury. "No one will question me, because you're just a useless slave."

Arachne's face turned blue, and she struggled to speak. "We're... preparing... breakfast... for Lucan," she gasped.

Benedicta released Arachne, who stumbled backward, gasping for air. Benedicta smiled,  before walking away.

As she entered the throne room, she heard Lucan's voice. "Make her beautiful, and bring her to my room." He said.

Benedicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with curiosity. Who was Lucan talking about?

She spotted Belladonna and Lilith, as they glared at Lucan. But they couldn't defy him, forced to obey his every command.

"Yes, my lord," they chorused, before leaving to carry out Lucan's orders.

Benedicta watched them go, a sly smile spreading across her face. She knew that Lucan was planning something and she can't wait to find out because she knows it's involving her.

She approached Lucan, who was sitting on his throne, his eyes fixed on some distant point. "What are you up to, my lord?" she asked, her voice husky.

Lucan's gaze snapped back to Benedicta, "I'm turning them into slaves," he said, his voice dripping with malice.

 "Their people will be shocked when I return them to the town."He smirk.

 She loved the way Lucan thought, his cunning and ruthlessness.

"I could kill them if they trespass, right?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lucan's expression turned cold, his eyes flashing with warning. "You won't kill anyone," he said, his voice firm.

Benedicta's smile faltered, but she quickly regained her composure. She knew that Lucan was still testing her, pushing her to see how far she would go.

She watched as Lucan left the throne room, She couldn't wait to become his woman, to reign beside him and wield power over the entire kingdom. She will make sure she impress him during their breakfast together.

But as she turned to leave, she felt a sudden pain in her arm. She stared at it, her eyes widening in horror. The wound where Epusa had bitten her was looking more deeper and dark, her vein visible beneath the surface.

She quickly rushed to her room, her heart racing with fear. She knew that she had to treat the wound, to stop the poison from spreading.

She rummaged through her chest, pulling out an ointment and chanting some spells before pouring it on the wound. She gasped as she felt a searing pain, the wound spreading to where the ointment reached.

She threw the ointment away, staring at her arm in horror. The wound was getting worse, the poison spreading rapidly.

She knew that she had to find a way to stop it, to cure the wound before it was too late. But as she looked at her arm, she couldn't shake off the feeling of dread. Was she doomed?.
.

Maledicta was led into Lucan's room by Lilith and Belladonna. The two girls exchanged a worried glance before leaving Maledicta alone with Lucan.

Maledicta approached the table, which was packed with a variety of delicacies. Lucan was seated at the other end, his eyes fixed intently on her. She stood at the front of the table, staring at the food without making a move.

"Sit down and eat," Lucan said coldly, his voice devoid of emotion.

But Maledicta didn't move. She stood her ground, her eyes flashing with defiance.

"I won't eat anything if my friends aren't given food too," she said stubbornly.

Lucan's expression turned icy, and he glared at Maledicta. For a moment, it seemed like he would lash out at her. But then, he laughed coldly and walked towards her.

"They are eating already, so sit down and eat," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Maledicta hesitated for a moment before sitting down. She looked up at Lucan, her eyes searching for answers.

"Why do you want me to eat?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lucan's smile grew wider, and he raised Maledicta's chin up with his finger. They stared at each other, eyeball to eyeball.

"It's simple, girl," he said, his voice low and husky. 

"I am feeding you so that you can get stronger and have enough strength to fight me. It wouldn't make sense if I killed you without a fight, would it?" He asked.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger, but Lucan just chuckled. He leaned in closer, his breath whispering against Maledicta's ear.

"So eat up, Male," he whispered, his voice sending shivers down Maledicta's spine.

"So eat up, Male," he whispered, his voice sending shivers down Maledicta's spine.

 "I want to see you at your strongest. I want to see you fight." He muttered.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, and she pushed Lucan away. She glared at him, her heart pounding with anger.

"I'll eat," she said, her voice cold. "But not because I want to fight you. I'll eat because I need to survive." She added.

Lucan's smile grew wider, and he nodded. "Whatever your reasons, Male. Just eat."

Maledicta hesitated for a moment before picking up a piece of bread. She took a bite, her eyes never leaving Lucan's face.

As she ate, Lucan watched her, his eyes gleaming with interest. He seemed to be studying her, analyzing her every move.

Maledicta felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that Lucan was playing a game with her. He was trying to break her, to make her submit to his will.

But Maledicta was determined not to give in. She would eat, she would survive, and she would find a way to bring the real Kaiden back.

As she finished her meal, Lucan nodded in approval. 

"With all this food, you're not looking any different," Lucan said after a few minutes, his eyes scanning Maledicta's face. He didn't even know why he was doing all this. Was it to torment her, or to genuinely help her.

Maledicta rolled her eyes. "What are you going to do now? Fight me?" she scoffed.

Lucan smirked. "No, not today. You have to become really stronger." He muttered.

Maledicta's eyes flashed with anger, and she stood up, pushing her chair back. 

"I've had enough of this," she muttered, before storming out of the room.

As she walked out, she met Benedicta, who was standing at the door. She was smiling but the smile disappeared when she saw Maledicta.

"What are you doing with him?" Benedicta asked, grabbing Maledicta's hand to prevent her from leaving.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, and she yanked her hand free, using a bit too much force. Benedicta stumbled backward, falling to the ground.

Maledicta glared at her. "You're still as weak as always. Or maybe weaker," she muttered, before turning to leave.

Benedicta's face twisted with anger, and she tried to stand up, but she felt a searing pain in her arm. She remained on the ground, glaring at Maledicta's back with anger.

"That witch will regret this," she hissed. 

"I'll be the one killing you." She added bitter fully.

Maledicta walked down the hallway, her heart pounding with anger. She met Arachne, who led her into a room where the other girls were waiting.

The room was large, with numerous beds and a few tables. Maledicta went to sit on one of the beds, feeling a bit exhausted.

"He's not that bad," Lilith said, trying to sound optimistic. "At least he gave us a room."

"And turned us into his slaves," Belladonna scoffed. "To think I always looked down on him, but now I have to bow and call him my lord. It's so annoying." She added while rolling her eyes.

Arachne turned around, a smile on her face.

 "I like it. I like the uniform too. I've always wondered what it would be like to be a maid." She said.

The two girls glared at her. 

"Do you know what he's up to?" Belladonna asked angrily while still glaring at Arachne.

 "He's going to make us suffer." She added.

Lilith nodded. "He's not the Kaiden you once knew. This is a monster." She said.

Maledicta shook her head. "He's not," she muttered.

The two girls finally noticed Maledicta was there, and their expressions turned worried.

"Are you okay?" Belladonna asked, checking Maledicta's body.

 "Why did he call for you? Did the jerk hurt you again?" Lilith asked.

Maledicta shook her head. "Just to eat."

The girls' eyes widened in surprise. 

"Really? Just that?" they asked in excitement.

Maledicta nodded. "Yeah, he wants me to be stronger so that we can have a proper fight. Or let say so that he can kill me” she said.

The excitement in their eyes cleared, replaced by worry.

"Oh," they muttered sadly.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed. "But I can see my Kaiden in his eyes. I could bring him back." She said.

Lilith's eyes widened. "How are you going to do that?"

Maledicta shook her head. "I don't know, but I have to figure something out. I'm sure he's going to leave me for some days." Ah She said.

Arachne looked worried. "What about our town?" She asked.

Maledicta's expression turned didn't change. "He won't go there until he kills me. I'm so sure of that. His focus is on me right now. He wants to mock them and the goddess too. So I still have a few days to do something." She said.

"I wish we could figure things out."Lilith muttered.

Just then, the door opened, and a guard entered.

 "Out," he said, and the girls quickly left the room.

"Except you," he pointed at Maledicta, before leaving with the others.

Maledicta sighed and lay on the bed. She started to remember how close they got during breakfast, how she almost felt like hugging him, kissing him, and doing all sorts of naughty things.

But she knew he was different now. He was far away, though he was near her. He looked more handsome, more mature, and more dangerous.

Maledicta's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with thoughts. She knew she had to be careful, that she had to keep her wits about her.

Because Lucan was a monster, and he would stop at nothing to get what he wanted and that is ruining her, making the whole town suffer and taking over the whole world.

A fleet of carriages arrived at the school, their horses' hooves pounding against the ground. The students, who had been hiding in the hideout, emerged cautiously, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of danger.

As they spotted the carriages, they rushed towards them, their faces filled with relief and excitement. The carriages were huge and luxurious, with intricate carvings and shimmering fabrics.

The students didn't waste any time, quickly climbing into the carriages and settling into their seats. The carriages were enchanted, and as soon as they were full, they lifted off the ground, soaring into the sky.

A senior student, who had been searching for Mistress Morwen, finally found her at the back of the school. She was standing in front of the shield, her eyes blazing with determination.

Mistress Morwen was trying to break through the shield, but it was proving to be a formidable task. Every time she tried to jump through, she was thrown back, her body crashing against the school's walls.

The senior student watched in horror as Mistress Morwen repeated this process, her body weakening with each attempt. She knew she had to stop her, but Mistress Morwen was too focused on her task.

"The carriages are here," the senior student said, trying to get Mistress Morwen's attention.

Mistress Morwen didn't respond, her eyes fixed on the shield.

 "That's the main reason I have to bring them with me," she muttered, before launching herself at the shield again.

The senior student caught her arm, holding her back. "Mistress, please, we have to leave. You can't continue doing this. The shield is sucking your energy, it could make you very weak." She said.

Mistress Morwen shook off the senior student's grip, her eyes blazing with anger. 

"I don't care. What did you expect me to tell the king about his children? What about the Alpha princes? What should I tell Alpha Ray? The other kids too?" She said.

The senior student tried to reason with her. "You should go to town and explain things to them. We'll come up with a solution. What can you do to Lucan even if you see him?" She said.

Mistress Morwen's face twisted with anger. "I'll tell him to release the innocent kids and take me instead." She said.

The senior student knew she had to stop Mistress Morwen before she hurt herself. But Mistress Morwen was too fast, launching herself at the shield once again.

This time, she was met with a blast of lightning, which struck her with incredible force. She fell to the ground, her body limp and lifeless.

The senior student rushed to her side, horror etched on her face. A few other students, who had been watching from a distance, rushed over to help.

Together, they carefully lifted Mistress Morwen's body and carried her to the last carriage. They climbed in, and the carriage took off, soaring into the sky.

As they flew away from the school, the students couldn't help but look back. The school was empty, void of life, and some of them couldn't help but cry.

They knew they would never see their school again, at least not until Lucan was defeated. The thought sent a shiver down their spines, and they huddled together, seeking comfort in each other's presence.

The carriages flew on, carrying the students to safety, but leaving behind a trail of uncertainty and fear.
.
.
.
.

"Where are they taking us to?" Belladonna scoffed, glaring at the guards ahead, who were just walking like a robot. 

"Maybe we're finally getting killed," Lilith said, rolling her eyes.

Arachne looked worried. "Don't say such cruel words, I'm afraid," she muttered.

As they entered the huge, beautiful garden, they all gasped, their eyes widening in shock. The garden was filled with various flowers, each one more breathtaking than the last.

"When does something like this exist among demons?" Lilith muttered, her eyes scanning the garden.

As they walked further into the garden, they saw the male students already doing some work. One of the guards approached them.

"We want them all watered," he said, before leaving.

"They're like talking trees."Belladonna scoffed.

The guys looked tired, like they'd been working for a while. But Cassius's face brightened when he saw Belladonna, as if his strength had been refilled.

"Are we supposed to water all of these?" Arachne asked, looking around at the flowers  fearfully.

Lilith nodded. "I think so."

She picked up a container from the ground, and the other girls followed suit. They fetched water from the beautiful waterfall in the garden.

It was only Lilith who could carry the water with ease; Arachne and Belladonna were walking weirdly, struggling to carry the heavy containers.

"Maybe it's not always good to be a princess," Lilith muttered, smiling wryly.

Belladonna was busy staring at Cassius, who was working nearby. She accidentally bumped into him, spilling some water on him. He stood up, laughing.

"Sorry," Belladonna muttered, still staring at him in a daze.

Cassius took some of the water and splashed it on her face. Belladonna immediately closed her eyes, cleaned the water off her face, and then opened her eyes to glare at Cassius playfully.

She dropped the water container and tried to slash at Cassius, but he dodged it easily. The water container hit Thane instead.

Thane smirked and took some water from Lilith's container, splashing it on her. Lilith immediately poured the remaining water on him.

Arachne smiled and poured water on Ryder, and that's how the water fight started. The girls fetched water in their containers and started pursuing the boys, splashing water on them.

By the time they were done, they were all tired, laughing and panting. They lay on the ground beside the waterfall, breathing heavily.

"We look so dirty," Cassius said, standing up. He took off his shirt and started moving toward the waterfall.

"What are you doing?" Thane asked.

"To shower, of course," Cassius replied, before jumping into the water.

Thane joined him immediately, and Belladonna and Arachne followed. Ryder and Lilith watched them, smiling.

Thane came out of the water and dragged Lilith in. Ryder kept watching them with a sad smile, his eyes fixed on the fun.

As they showered and played in the water, the tension and fear they'd been feeling seemed to melt away. For a moment, they forgot about their situation and just enjoyed each other's company.
.
.
.
.

Benedicta entered Lucan's room, her eyes scanning the space to find him staring out the window, his expressionless face a mask of calm. She walked up to stand beside him, her eyes following his gaze to the students playing in the waterfall below.

"I will make sure they are punished for disobeying you," she said, her voice dripping with venom.

But Lucan's voice stopped her as she turned to leave.

 "Don't," he muttered coldly.

Benedicta rolled her eyes, her expression twisting with annoyance, before standing beside him again.

"That boy," Lucan said, pointing at Ryder, who was standing alone, not joining in the fun.   

"I want to see him later." He added.

"Why will you...I mean, okay," she quickly said, trying to cover up her question when Lucan glared at her.

They watched in silence as Arachne came out of the water and dragged Ryder in, the two of them laughing and splashing around.

"Let them enjoy today," Lucan said coldly. "Tomorrow might be different."

Benedicta's eyes gleamed with excitement at the prospect of what tomorrow might bring. She loved the idea of chaos and destruction, and she knew that Lucan was the perfect person to bring that about.

As Lucan started to leave, Benedicta quickly ran after him. 

"When are we attacking the town?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "I can't wait, my lord."

Lucan's expression turned cold, his eyes glinting with annoyance. "Not now," he muttered.

Benedicta's face fell, her excitement deflating. "But why?" she asked, her voice tinged with disappointment. "Isn't that always what you want to do?"

Lucan's gaze snapped back to hers, his eyes piercing. "I know what I'm doing," he said.

Benedicta nodded, trying to look obedient, but inside, she was seething with frustration. She hated being kept in the dark, hated not knowing what Lucan's plans were.

As Lucan started to leave again, Benedicta thought she was going to be dismissed. But then, he suddenly stopped and turned back to her, his eyes narrowing.

"I could see death around you," he said, his voice low. "Are you okay?"

Benedicta's heart skipped a beat, her mind racing with surprise.

"Yeah, my lord," she quickly said, trying to brush off her concern.

Lucan's gaze lingered on hers for a moment before he nodded and left without sparing her another glance.

Benedicta smiled to herself, a bright red blush spreading across her cheeks. 

"He cares about me," she muttered, her heart skipping a beat at the thought.

But her smile quickly faltered as she felt a searing pain in her arm. She gasped, her eyes widening in horror as she opened her arm to reveal the wound.

It was getting bigger, spreading every second. Benedicta knew she had to get rid of it, but how?.
.
.
.
.

"Please be okay, I don't know what the jerk is up to now," Belladonna said angrily as she led Maledicta into Lucan's room. Maledicta looked beautiful in the clothes she was wearing, her long hair cascading down her back like a waterfall.

Belladonna bowed before leaving, and Maledicta walked closer to Lucan, who was sitting on the bed with a cup of wine in his hand. He was shirtless, his chest muscles rippling in the dim light of the room. Maledicta tried her best not to admire him, but she couldn't help sneaking glances.

"What did you want from me?" she asked, trying to sound brave.

Lucan's eyes roamed around her body, his gaze lingering on her curves. 

"I saw your friends having fun some hours ago, and I thought about you. How about we have some fun together?" he suggested, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta's heart skipped a beat. What did he mean by "fun"? She didn't trust him one bit.

"What did you want?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

Lucan's smile grew wider. "I want you to entertain me. Dance for me, Male," he said coldly.

Maledicta's heart fluttered weirdly at the way he called her "Male". She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself she was being ridiculous.

"I'll never do that," she said, turning to leave.

But Lucan was too quick. He grabbed her hair from behind, his eyes blazing with anger.

"Don't you ever dare walk away from me again, ever," he growled, his voice low and menacing.

Maledicta glared at him, tears welling up in her eyes. She tried to struggle, but Lucan's grip was too tight.

Suddenly, Lucan's expression changed. He looked... uncertain. His grip on her hair released, and he took a step back.

"Are you okay?" he asked gently, his eyes searching hers.

Maledicta didn't respond. She just stared at him, her heart pounding in her chest. He walk closer and cup her cheeks in his palm, he gently clean her tears.

Lucan's face twisted and he move back, he turned his back on her. 

"Get out," he snapped.

Maledicta didn't move, she continued staring at him.

"Kaiden, are you there?" she asked gently while moving closer to him.

Lucan's head jerked up, his eyes narrowing.

 "Don't call me that. Out. Now," he yelled, his voice echoing through the room.

Maledicta quickly went toward the door, she closed the door behind her, her heart still pounding. What had just happened?

Lucan stood in the middle of the room, staring at his palm. He couldn't believe what he just did, he felt bad seeing her tears and he couldn't understand why that happen.

    “What is wrong with me” he muttered in confusion.

"He is waiting inside," the guard muttered before leaving.

Ryder took a deep breath before entering the room. He saw Lucan sitting on a chair, his eyes fixed on him. Ryder went to stand in front of him, a little confused about why he had been called.

"Sit down," Lucan said, his voice cold and detached.

Ryder sat down in the chair opposite him, his eyes locked on the ground.

"Look at me," Lucan said, his voice firm.

Ryder looked up to meet his eyes, feeling a shiver run down his spine.

"I hear we are friends," Lucan said, his eyes narrowing.

"Yeah, we are friends," Ryder said with a smile, trying to sound casual.

Lucan stared at his face, his eyes searching for something. "Can you tell me who I am?" he asked.

Ryder hesitated for a momentbefore speaking. "You are the most friendly person I've met. At first, I didn't like you because you're human, but as I got to know you, we became really close. I even told you my secret." He said.

Lucan's expression didn't change, but Ryder could sense a flicker of emotion behind his eyes.

"Did you expect me to believe that?" Lucan asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Didn't you befriend me because I'm weak?" He scoffed.

Ryder shook his head. "I didn't. You're not weak. Though you're different from us, you didn't let that get to you." He said.

Lucan's eyes narrowed. "What about Maledicta? Did I have some sort of relationship with her?" He asked.

Ryder nodded. "You two are really close. You're like her only friend. When No one else is around." He said 

Lucan's expression turned cold. "I don't believe any of this. I don't know why you're lying. You can leave now, and don't think you're special to me." He said.

Ryder stood up, his eyes locked on Lucan's.

 "I'll make sure I do what I can to bring you back, Kaiden. Just hang in there." He said.

Lucan scoffed, but Ryder could see a glimmer of uncertainty in his eyes. Ryder left the room, feeling a sense of determination.

As soon as Ryder left, Lucan grabbed his head, groaning in pain.

"What is he talking about?" Lucan scoffed, but suddenly, he had a flashback. Someone was telling him something, though he couldn't see the person's face.

"I hate attention. I prefer people not knowing about my identity. You are the only one who knows now, so please don't tell anyone that I'm a prince."

Lucan's eyes snapped open, and he stood up, his mind reeling. What was that? He didn't remember anything about being a prince.

He slowly walked toward the window and saw the students sitting and talking. He stared at them for a while, feeling a sense of disconnection.

He didn't know what to believe. If only he could remember his memories. He hated the way these people were making him feel weak.

"Tell them to go to their rooms," he told one of the guards before laying down on the bed.

His mind drifted to Maledicta, and he groaned frustratedly. 

She just had to become stronger, then he would take her to her town. They would fight in front of her people, and he would kill her, destroy Nightshade, and take over the world.

Lucan smiled to himself. He would show them all what he was capable of. He would show them all what it meant to be Lucan.

Benedicta sat in her dimly lit room, the black magic book lying open in front of her. She had been searching for a solution to her problem for what felt like hours, and finally, she had found it. She took a deep breath, focusing her energy, and began to chant the words of the spell.

The air in the room began to charged with electricity, and a wild wind started to blow, rustling the pages of the book and sending Benedicta's long hair flying around her face. She didn't flinch, her eyes closed in concentration.

As she spoke the final words of the spell, the room fell silent once more. Benedicta opened her eyes, a smile spreading across her face as she saw that the water in the small bowl in front of her had turned a deep purple color.

She laughed, a cold, mirthless sound, and dipped her fingers into the water. She sprinkled a few drops onto the wound on her arm, but it didn't budge. Benedicta's smile faltered, and she groaned in frustration.

She tried again, chanting a different spell and turning the water a golden color. This time, when she applied the water to the wound, it began to glow, and the wound started to close. Benedicta's eyes lit up with excitement, but her joy was short-lived.

As soon as the wound had vanished, it reappeared, bigger and more painful-looking than before. Benedicta screamed in anger, slamming her fist onto the table.

She knew that she couldn't keep hiding the wound forever. It was going to take over her arm, and she wouldn't be able to conceal it anymore. She thought about telling Lucan, but she didn't want to appear weak in front of him.

She had to be strong, capable, and worthy if she wanted to be by his side. But things weren't working out as planned. She pulled out Maledicta's book and flipped through the pages, searching for any clues that might help her.

But there was nothing. Benedicta threw the books away in anger, and Maledicta's book slid under the bed. The black magic book, however, remained open, and Benedicta's eyes landed on a page that made her heart skip a beat. She gently walk closer and carry the book up.

"Poison by demons can't be healed by black magic, but it can be transferred to another person's body. All you need is their blood." A wide smile spread across Benedicta's face as she read the words.

She hugged the book to her chest, a plan forming in her mind. All she needed was the blood of one of the students, and she was sure it would be easy to get. She would just have to choose the right person…the unlucky one.

Ryder walked through the dimly lit corridor, the silence of the night enveloping him like a shroud. Others were asleep, but he couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been plaguing him all day. He had to do something, anything, to take his mind off the events that had been unfolding.

As he turned a corner, he saw a door about to open and quickly hid in the shadows, peeking out to see Benedicta emerging from the room. She looked around suspiciously, her eyes scanning the corridor before she walked away.

Ryder waited until she was out of sight before emerging from his hiding spot. He was sure that was her room, and his conscience was telling him to enter. He slowly turned the handle and slipped inside, his heart racing with anticipation.

He quickly moved into the room, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. He heard the footsteps of guards approaching and quickly hid behind the door, holding his breath as they walked by.

When the coast was clear, Ryder emerged from his hiding spot and began to search the room. Maybe he could find something that would help him understand what was going on. He checked all of Benedicta's belongings, but couldn't find anything that seemed out of the ordinary.

He groaned in frustration, feeling like he was getting nowhere. He started to leave, but his foot hit something under the bed. He quickly bent down and pulled out the big book.

Ryder's eyes widened in shock as he saw that it was Maledicta's book - the same book he had stolen from his grandfather. How did it end up in Benedicta's possession? The book was supposed to be with Aka, so how did Benedicta get her hands on it?

Ryder quickly hid the book in his shirt and moved towards the door. He slowly turned the handle and peeked outside, but his heart sank as he saw Benedicta standing outside, a cold smile spreading across her face.

"What are you doing in my room?" she asked, her eyes narrowing as she eyed him suspiciously.

Ryder tried to think quickly, but his mind was a blank.

 "I was looking for you," he muttered, trying to adjust the book so that it wouldn't be noticeable.

Benedicta raised an eyebrow. "Why did you want to see me?" she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Ryder took a deep breath, trying to gather his thoughts. 

"I want to ask you about Aka. Did...you...kill her?" he asked gently.

Benedicta's smile grew wider, and she moved closer to Ryder. 

"What did you ask?" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ryder felt a shiver run down his spine as he looked into her eyes.

 "I just keep thinking about it. I just think you're the only one who could kill her in the whole school." He said.

Benedicta's laughter sent chills down Ryder's spine.

 "I did kill her. So what are you going to do? Kill me too?" she smirked.

Ryder felt a surge of anger, but he knew he had to keep his cool. 

"What can I do? I just want to know."he said and started leaving.

“Yeah, You'll never be able to do anything to me." Benedicta said, he didn't respond and just walk pass her.

Ryder felt a stinging sensation as Benedicta dug her nails deep into his arm. 

"Stay away from me, from my room. I can't guarantee your safety if I see you again, so avoid me." She said.

Ryder glared at her, but he knew he had to leave. He turned and walked away, feeling a sense of unease.

As soon as he was out of sight, Benedicta entered her room, a wide smile spreading across her face. She checked her hand and smirked when she saw Ryder's blood.

She made the blood come together and dropped it into a small bottle. 

"The unlucky one," she chuckled, her eyes gleaming with malice.
.
.
.

A bright blue light filled the room, illuminating the sleeping forms of Maledicta and the other girls. The light was like a shining blue ball, and it moved towards Maledicta with an otherworldly purpose.

As the light reached her, it shone brightly on her face, and Maledicta's eyes fluttered open. She watched in wonder as the blue ball dropped onto her lap, and then, in an instant, it transformed into a letter and something wrapped in cloth.

Maledicta's heart was racing as she quickly opened the letter and began to read. The words danced across the page, written in her mother's familiar handwriting.

"Maledicta, hope you are okay. We are in the town with the other students, so don't worry. The elder and the people are finding a way to save you all." 

Maledicta's face lit up with a smile as she read the words. 

As she continued to read, her smile faltered. "I send you another thing, please make use of it and save us all."

Maledicta's heart was pounding as she slowly picked up the cloth-wrapped object. She unwrapped it, revealing a small golden dagger. The dagger glowed in her hand, and Maledicta felt a shiver run down her spine.

She returned to the letter, her eyes scanning the page with a growing sense of dread.

 "With that dagger, stab straight to Lucan's heart. You could kill him. I know this is hard for you, but this is the purpose you were born for. Please make use of the dagger and save your land and people from the claw of the monster."

Maledicta's eyes widened in shock as she finished reading the letter. She felt like she had been punched in the gut. How could they expect her to kill Kaiden, the only man she had ever loved? Her mind was reeling with conflicting emotions.

She threw the letter and dagger down, her eyes fixed on the dagger as if it was a snake. She couldn't believe what she was being asked to do. Kill Kaiden? It was unthinkable.

Maledicta continued to stare at the dagger, her mind racing with thoughts and emotions. She couldn't move, couldn't think. All she could do was stare at the dagger, her heart heavy with sorrow and conflict.

As the hours passed, the room grew lighter, and the other girls began to stir. But Maledicta didn't move. She remained frozen, her eyes fixed on the dagger, her heart torn apart by the impossible choice she had been given.
.
.
.
.

Benedicta stormed into the garden, her eyes scanning the area with a mixture of anger and disgust. She had expected to see the students hard at work, but instead, they were laughing and chatting like they were at a social gathering.

Her eyes narrowed as she spotted Ryder, Thane, Cassius, Belladonna, Lilith, and Arachne all gathered together, looking like they were having the time of their lives. She wanted to confront them.
But something stopped her. Maybe it was the way Ryder was smiling, or the way Cassius was gazing at Belladonna with adoration in his eyes. Whatever it was, Benedicta found herself hesitating, and instead of confronting them, she decided to listen in on their conversation.

"I have something to show you all tonight," Ryder said.

"What?" Thane asked, his curiosity piqued.

"You just have to wait," Ryder said, grinning.

Cassius plucked a flower from the garden and tucked it behind Belladonna's ear. 

"You look so pretty, just like the flower," he said, making Belladonna scoff.

Lilith and Thane kept stealing glances at each other, their eyes locked. They hadn't been able to talk, not since their argument.

"Look, he's looking at us," Arachne said, nodding towards the window.

The group turned to look, and Benedicta followed their gaze. Lucan was standing at the window, his eyes fixed on the group. He didn't look fazed, just continued to stare.

"I think he's looking at Maledicta," Lilith said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think they still have some sort of connection."

"Yeah, or why else would he want to keep seeing her every night?" Belladonna grinned.

Maledicta didn't say anything.

"He called for me yesterday, and we talked," Ryder said, smiling.

The others laughed, and Benedicta's anger boiled over. She turned and stormed back to the palace, she is ready to confront Lucan.

As she reached the throne room, she stopped, her eyes fixed on Lucan. He was talking to some guards, giving them instructions.

"Make a beautiful room for her beside mine," he said. "Make sure it has everything she needs. Tell me when it's done."

The guards bowed and left, and Benedicta's eyes narrowed. What was Lucan doing? Why was he being so nice to Maledicta?

She didn't enter the room, instead standing at the door, glaring at Lucan with anger. She was sure it wouldn't mean anything to him, even if she confronted him. He wasn't listening to her, wasn't taking her advice.

 She would take care of the students herself. She would make sure they didn't get in the way of Lucan's plans. And she would make sure that Maledicta paid for stealing Lucan's attention.
.
.
.

The students were still talking and laughing when Benedicta suddenly appeared with a group of guards. Her eyes were blazing with anger, and her voice was cold and menacing.

"You were told to work in the garden, but you ignored the lord's command and did something else," she spat. "You will be punished by getting beaten almost to death."

The guards closed in, their faces expressionless. Cassius stepped forward, his eyes flashing with anger.

"Did you think you can do us the way you please?" he snarled.

Benedicta smirked, "Well, it wasn't me, it was Lord Lucan," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

She signaled to the guards, and they began to approach the students. The students tried to fight back, but they were too strong. Soon, they were all tied to a tree, helpless and defenseless.

The guards began to beat them with long, thorny wires. Each hit left deep wounds and curses on their bodies. The guys were flogged first, and by the time they were done, they were looking weak and tired.

Then, it was the girls' turn. The first lash sent tears streaming down Arachne's face, and she was wiping them away as they continued to lash her. Ryder tried to release himself, but the rope was too strong.

Cassius almost lost his mind as he screamed when Belladonna was being flogged. Then, it was Lilith's turn. They kept lashing and lashing, and Thane couldn't bear it anymore.

His wolf, Tan, took over immediately, and he cut the rope easily. But he was quickly held down by the guards.

"Don't touch her, don't touch my mate!" he growled angrily, but he was overpowered.

When it was Maledicta's turn to be whipped, Benedicta collected the whip and started hitting her mercilessly. Maledicta's back was full of bruises and deep wounds, and she was weak, but Benedicta didn't stop.

She continued to hit her again and again, a wicked smile spreading across her face. She was about to hit her again when someone suddenly caught her hand.

"How dare you touch her?" Lucan asked angrily, his eyes blazing with fury.

Benedicta, still holding her arm in pain, managed to speak. "My lord, they are disrespectful of your command."

Lucan's expression turned even darker. 

"What did I tell you about hurting them?" he asked, his voice low and menacing.

Benedicta tried to explain, but Lucan was beyond reason. He threw her away, and she crashed into a nearby tree, her back hitting the trunk with a loud thud. She fell to the ground, groaning in pain.

"You can't show them your weakness, you have to show them how powerful you are," Benedicta said, trying to appeal to Lucan's rational side.

 "They will betray you, my lord." She added weakly.

But Lucan was not interested in listening. He supersped to Benedicta and threw her away again, his eyes blazing with anger.

"Don't ever think you can give me advice again," he muttered, his voice cold and detached. "Live here quietly, or I won't spare you."

Lucan turned and walked towards Maledicta, who was barely conscious. He glared at the guards, and they immediately burned to ashes. The guards that followed him quickly released the others.

Lucan untied Maledicta and carried her in his arms, his expression softening as he looked at her. He started to leave, and the others followed, still looking shell-shocked.

Lilith was still looking at Thane, her eyes fixed on him with a mixture of confusion and curiosity. She couldn't forget what he had called her - "mate."

They were all led away, leaving Benedicta alone in the garden, her eyes fixed on Lucan's retreating back with a mixture of anger and resentment.

Lucan took Maledicta to his room and gently dropped her onto the bed. He looked at her with a mixture of concern and frustration.

"Why didn't you fight her?" he asked, his voice softening. "Are you that weak?"

Maledicta smiled weakly, her eyes still cloudy with pain.

 "I am not weak," she said.

 "I just wanted you to come and save me, and you came." She said with a smile.

"I can't believe you right now," he scoffed, his anger and frustration evident in his voice. He turned and walked away, disappearing into the bathroom.

Maledicta was taken aback by his sudden outburst. She didn't know what to make of it. Was he angry with her? Or was it something else?

Lucan returned with a bowl of warm water and a white fabric. He approached Maledicta, his eyes flashing with a mixture of anger and concern.

"Stand up," he said, his voice firm but gentle.

Maledicta stood up, feeling a little self-conscious. Lucan took off her dress, trying to avoid staring at her bare skin. He dropped the dress on the ground, and Maledicta felt a flush rise to her cheeks.

She was naked to his eyes, and he laid her on the bed, her back facing him. His face deepened in anger when he saw the scars and wounds on her back. He almost felt like killing Benedicta immediately.

He started cleaning the wounds with the fabric, his touch gentle but firm. As he did, the wounds began to heal, her back becoming scarless and smooth.

When he was done, he covered her with the duvet, since she was already asleep. He sat beside the bed, his mind running around with different thoughts.

He couldn't understand why he was so angry seeing her hurt. Isn't she supposed to be an enemy? Someone who was going to kill him?

He kept watching her, his eyes fixed on her peaceful face. He felt a strange sense of calm wash over him, and before he knew it, he fell asleep, his head falling onto the bed beside her.

It was the chirping of the birds that woke Maledicta up. She sat up on the bed and stretched, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She didn't feel any pain.

She checked her back and realized that the pain was gone. That made her incredibly happy. She also noticed that she was still naked and blushed.

She saw Lucan still sleeping and admired his features. He was looking so handsome that her heart was beating loudly. She started moving her hand closer to him, but his eyes snapped open.

"Why are you still here?" he asked coldly, his eyes narrowing.

"I just woke up," she said, feeling a little self-conscious.

He stood up and threw her dress at her. 

"Put it on and leave," he said, his voice firm. He turned and walked into the bathroom.

Maledicta rolled her eyes before putting on her dress. She left the room, feeling a little confused. What was going on with Lucan?

She met a guard at the door. "Follow me," the guard said and took her to the room next door.

They both entered the beautiful room, and Maledicta's eyes widened in surprise. The room was stunning, with beautiful decorations and furniture.

"This is your room now," the guard said and left before she could say anything.

Maledicta stared at the beautiful decorations, feeling a sense of wonder. She lay on the bed, relief wash over her.

"He gave me this room," she muttered to herself, a smile spreading across her face. "That means my Kaiden is still there."

She felt a sense of hope rising up in her chest. Maybe, just maybe, she could still save Lucan. Maybe she could still bring back the Kaiden she loved.

Thane entered the garden, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of Lilith. He spotted her just as she was about to exit the garden, and his heart skipped a beat.

They didn't say anything to each other, and instead, they just walked past each other. But Thane couldn't shake off the feeling that he needed to talk to her.

He suddenly turned and ran after her, his feet pounding the pavement. But as he turned the corner, he was surprised to see Lilith coming back towards him.

They both smiled nervously, and Thane felt his heart flutter in his chest.

"How is your wound?" Thane asked, his voice filled with concern. "I hope you're not feeling any pain."

Lilith smiled,  "No, we were given herbs yesterday, and surprisingly, they worked." She said.

Thane's face lit up with relief. "I'm glad," he said, his voice sincere.

Lilith's expression turned serious, and she looked at Thane with a hint of curiosity.

 "Yesterday, you said something," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane's smile faltered, and he looked away, feeling a little embarrassed.

 "It was Tan, I don't know why he said that," he muttered.

Lilith's face fell, and she turned to leave. But Thane suddenly perceived a sweet smell coming from her, the same scent he had been dreaming of since his brother found his mate.

He quickly grabbed her arm, a bright smile spreading across his face. 

"You're really my mate, Lilith," he exclaimed.

Lilith's eyes widened in surprise, and she looked at Thane with a mixture of confusion and excitement. 

"But how is that even possible?" she asked.

 "I haven't even thought of that before."she added.

Thane's smile grew wider, and he pulled Lilith into a tight hug.

 "Maybe the moon goddess saw our sincerity and decided to grant our wish," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

Lilith chuckled, and they both hugged each other tightly, feeling a sense of joy and relief wash over them.

"I'm so glad that I'm your mate," Lilith said, her voice barely above a whisper.

 "I couldn't bear the thought of you having another girl in your arms." She added silently.

Thane's heart swelled with emotion, and he gently cleaned Lilith's tears. He pecked her cheeks, feeling a sense of happiness he had never felt before.

"I'm more glad," he said, his voice sincere. "Now I can do whatever I have to do with you without feeling any fear. I miss you so much, Lilith – our fights, the way we talk, and everything."

Lilith's eyes welled up with tears, and she smiled, feeling a sense of joy and love. 

"I miss you too, so much," she said. "I felt like my heart would break into pieces."

Thane's face lit up with a bright smile, and he leaned in to kiss Lilith. She reciprocated immediately, their hearts beating loudly against their ribcages.

"I love you," Lilith said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thane's smile grew wider, and he deepened the kiss. "I love you too," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

As they kissed, they both forgot about their problems, forgot about the danger that lurked around them. All they could think about was each other, and the love that they shared.

"We will survive this and have a great life together," Lilith said, her voice filled with determination. "So please, fight for your life."

Thane's expression turned serious, "I will," he said. "And I will also protect you with my life. I won't allow any harm to come to you again." He said.

Lilith smiled, feeling relief wash over her. She knew that Thane would do everything in his power to protect her, and she was grateful for that.

As they continued to kiss, they both knew that they would face whatever challenges came their way, together. They were mates, and nothing could ever break that bond.

Belladonna was walking around in another part of the forest, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere, when someone suddenly touched her back. She turned around, ready to defend herself, and saw Cassius standing behind her.

"What are you doing?" she scoffed, trying to hide the surprise from her voice.

Cassius smiled and presented her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

 "For my lady," he said, his eyes shining with sincerity.

Belladonna didn't say anything, just turned to leave. But as she walked away, she couldn't help but smile. She had expected Cassius to follow her, to try and persuade her to talk to him. But instead, he just stood there, watching her walk away.

She turned back to see him walking slowly, staring at the flowers in his hand. 

"Where are you going?" she asked while walking closer to him.

Cassius looked up, his eyes meeting hers. "To the room," he muttered.

Belladonna felt a pang of disappointment. She had thought that maybe, just maybe, Cassius was finally going to make a move, to try and win her back. But instead, he just seemed to be giving up.

"I thought you were planning to hang out with me," she said, trying to keep her tone light.

Cassius looked up at her, his eyes filled with sadness. "I was, but it seems that you don't want me to. Why can't you just see my sincerity, Belladonna? I know I offended you, but I keep trying. But you don't seem to think of my effort."

Belladonna felt a pang of guilt. She knew that Cassius was trying, that he was genuinely sorry for what he had done. But she was still hurt, still afraid of getting hurt again.

"You hurt me too," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

 "You told me that nothing would ever happen between us. Have you forgotten all that?" She added.

Cassius looked down, his eyes filling with tears. 

"It's my fault," he said, his voice cracking. 

"I guess I have to suffer from you then. I just feel so hurt. I am sorry, Belladonna. It's okay if you decide not to ever forgive me again. I totally deserve it." He said.

Belladonna felt her heart melt at Cassius's words. She knew that he was genuinely sorry, that he was willing to do anything to make things right between them.

She quickly went to hug him from the back. 

"I have forgiven you," she said, her voice filled with emotion. "And I still love you. I am just afraid." She said.

Cassius turned to face her, his eyes filled with hope. "Why are you afraid?" he asked.

Belladonna took a deep breath. "It's because you want me when I change. I was afraid you will change again if I give you attention. I thought you might hate me again. That's why I decided to continue that way, maybe you will keep wanting me." She said gently.

Cassius's face filled with understanding. "I will never do that again," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "You mean a lot to me, and I love you so much."

Belladonna smiled sadly. "I am sorry for treating you like you are nothing." She said.

Cassius's eyes filled with tears. "I should be the one apologizing. I didn't even deserve you." He said.

Belladonna moved closer into his body, and Cassius hugged her immediately, sniffing her neck.

 "I am glad to have someone like you as a mate," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

"I can't wait to mark you and make you mine," he growled into her ear, making Belladonna's heart skip a beat.

She pushed him away, laughing.

 "Pervert," she snapped, and started leaving.

Cassius ran after her, his heart leaping in joy. He knew that he still had a long way to go, but he was willing to do anything to make things right between them.

As they walked, Cassius couldn't help but feel grateful. He had almost lost Belladonna, but he had managed to win her back. And he was determined to never let her go again.

   He swept her into his arm and turn around with a bright smile.

    “What are you doing?” She gasp.

    “Showing everyone that you belong to me” he said and bite her neck again. She blush and rest her head on his chest as they walk around the garden.

    “Aren't you tired?” She asked after some minutes.

    “I will never be tired with you mate” Cass growl.

Ryder caught up with Arachne as they walked through the corridor.

 "Hey," he said, falling into step beside her.

Arachne didn't say anything, just smiled gently. Ryder noticed that she seemed a little subdued, and his concern grew.

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice laced with worry.

Arachne hesitated, her eyes dropping to the floor. "I just couldn't stop thinking," she muttered. "What if we return to the town, will you ever consider me?"

Ryder's expression softened. "What are you talking about?" he asked. "You are my future wife."

Arachne's eyes lifted, and Ryder saw a hint of sadness in them. 

"But you don't like me," she said. "I am okay if we break the engagement. I don't want you to force yourself into something you don't like."

Ryder's face lit up with surprise. "Says who?" he asked. "I like the fact that you are my future wife."

A bright smile spread across Arachne's face, and Ryder's heart swelled with emotion. He loved seeing her happy.

"Really?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ryder nodded. "Of course," he said. "So stop feeling insecure and protect yourself in here."

Arachne's smile grew wider, and she threw her arms around Ryder. He parted her back, holding her close.

"I have something to give you," she said, pulling back.

Ryder watched as Arachne removed a beautiful butterfly design golden bracelet from her wrist. She handed it to him, and Ryder's eyes widened in surprise.

"My sister gave this to me the last time we met before her death," Arachne explained. "She said it's going to protect me, and I think it really worked."

Ryder's eyes met Arachne's, and he saw the sincerity in them. "Why will you give me something special like that?" he asked.

Arachne smiled. "Because you are also special to me."

"Thank you," he muttered, his voice filled with emotion.

Arachne smiled and pointed to Ryder's arm. "Wear it," she said.

Ryder smiled and put on the bracelet. It felt strange but also comforting.

"It looks so good on you," Arachne said, her eyes shining with happiness.

"I have something to show others, l think you should be there too." He said.

Arachne's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "What is it?" she asked.

Ryder smiled. "You'll see," he said, his eyes glinting with mischief.

Together, they left the corridor.

.

The others were already in the guys' room, waiting for Ryder to arrive. Ryder went to retrieve the book where he had hidden it. As he entered the room, Thane's eyes landed on the book in Ryder's hand.

"Where did you see a book like this?" Thane asked, his curiosity piqued.

Ryder's expression turned somber. "This is the book I took from my grandfather. I gave it to Aka, and I found it in Benedicta's room. She confirmed killing Aka herself."

The room fell silent, with everyone's eyes fixed on Ryder. Belladonna's face twisted in anger.

"That witch, I should have known," she spat.

Maledicta quickly collected the book and opened it.

 "I will read it to everyone. I think we could find some clue in it," Ryder said, and everyone leaned in to listen as he began to read.

As Ryder read the story, their eyes were full of surprises. The room was silent, with everyone's attention fixed on the book.

"Wow, so Maledicta wasn't cursed," Lilith said in shock, breaking the silence.

"And she is meant to kill Lucan, who is also Kaiden," Belladonna added, her voice filled with surprise.

Ryder quickly spoke up. "We can't do that. We have to find another way."

Cassius looked worried, his eyes fixed on the book. "What are we going to do now?"

Arachne suddenly took the book from Maledicta and started flipping through the pages. She stopped at a particular page, muttered some spell, and the page split into two.

The room fell silent again, with everyone staring at Arachne in shock.

"Wow, how did you do that?" Lilith asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Arachne smiled. "A magic was cast on it so that it's not everyone who will see the page, but I could sense it."

They all stared at the content written on the particular page, which was in golden color.

"Their miserable fate can be stopped if they get intimate three times. The goddess could see their heart and sincerity and granted the demon (Lucan) a second chance," the page read.

Ryder grinned happily. "Does that mean we have a way?"

Maledicta smiled, finally breathing a sigh of relief. "I think so."

 "There's still a problem. Have you guys gotten intimate three times?"Lilith asked 

Maledicta's face turned bright red. "No, just once." She muttered.

The room fell silent again, with everyone looking at each other in surprise.

"What? What are you both doing all this while? Playing around?"Belladonna scoffed.

"What are we going to do now?"Thane groaned. 

Belladonna and Lilith suddenly looked at each other and smiled mischievously.

Arachne raised an eyebrow. "Why are you both smiling?"

But Belladonna and Lilith didn't respond. Instead, they dragged Maledicta away with them, leaving the others looking at each other in confusion.
.
.
.
.

"Are you sure this is going to work?" Maledicta asked, her voice trembling slightly as they pushed her towards Lucan's room.

"Yeah, just do all we taught you, you still remember the move, right?" Lilith asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Maledicta nodded, trying to calm her nerves. 

"What if he throws me out?" she panicked.

Belladonna opened the door and pushed her in before she could change her mind. 

"He won't," she said confidently.

Maledicta looked around the room nervously, her heart racing with anticipation. She didn't even know why she was feeling so nervous; she had done this before, after all.

She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that Lucan wasn't around and turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, a voice stopped her.

"What are you doing here?" Lucan asked, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta turned back to see him staring at her, his eyes narrowing slightly as he took in her appearance. He was just coming out of the shower, water dripping from his hair and body.

She gulped nervously and put on a smile, trying to play it cool.

 "I am here to dance for you, like you requested that day," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lucan raised an eyebrow, a smirk spreading across his face. 

"Really?" he said, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Let me see what you got."

He walked over to the bed and sat down, his eyes never leaving hers. Maledicta took a deep breath and dropped the clothes she was wearing, revealing the beautiful short robe underneath.

Lucan's eyes widened slightly as he took in her appearance, his gaze roaming over her body. Maledicta started dancing, moving her waist in sexy ways, her eyes locked on Lucan's.

She moved closer to him, her body swaying to the music, and started caressing his body. She even sat down on his lap and moved sexily, her eyes never leaving his.

Lucan's concentration was on her, his eyes burning with desire. Maledicta smiled to herself, knowing that she was having the desired effect on him.

She wanted to stand up, but was suddenly pushed back onto the bed, Lucan on top of her. She gasped as she saw his red eyeballs staring at her lustfully.

"You are going to pay for waking the devil inside me, Male," he growled, his voice low and husky.

"You are going to pay for waking the devil inside me, Male," he growled, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta's heart skipped a beat as she looked up at Lucan, her body trembling with anticipation. she also knew that she had to do this, that she had to seduce Lucan and make him fall in love with her. It was the only way to save him, all of them.

So she smiled up at Lucan, her eyes locked on his, and reached up to caress his face. 

"I'm not afraid of you, Lucan," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Lucan's eyes narrowed, his face inches from hers.

 "You should be," he growled, his breath hot against her skin.

And with that, he kissed her, his lips crashing down on hers in a passionate and possessive kiss. Maledicta felt her body melt into his, her heart racing with excitement.

She knew that she was playing with fire, but she couldn't. help herself. She was drawn to Lucan, despite his cruel and ruthless nature.

His hand moved under her robe and she closed her eyes enjoying what he was doing. He was rough, like a beast but she also liked it. She loved the way he did it.

   He was sucking on her neck when he suddenly entered her, her eyes snapped open in shock because of the force he was using, he was moving at a fast speed and she was feeling a little pain but soon they were gone and replaced with the moan of pleasure. He keeps going like a beast till he finally comes. He was breathing heavily, he just pushed her closer and she lay her head on his chest, he started caressing her hair, none of them said anything to each other but Maledicta felt calm, she had been wishing to be in his arms for a while.

    “Sleep” he whispered gently to her ear and just like a command, her eyes started closing slightly and before she knew it, she was already asleep. Lucan stared at her face and touched his chest. He was feeling weird, his heart was beating loudly and he felt strange. He felt a lot of emotions toward her and hurting is far from it, instead, he wanted to protect her from any harm that could happen to her.

    “You are driving me crazy” he said gently and smiled seeing her cute pout as she slept. He immediately frowned.

 “What did I just do” he muttered to himself and try to stand up but her head stopped him, he try to move her head from his chest but she move more closer to him, he groan and stay still because he doesn't want to wake her up, he finally close his eyes and soon fell asleep.
.

.
.

Everyone at the coven was already asleep, but Benedicta was not. She was preparing for her ritual, her eyes gleaming with manaic, in the dimly lit room. She drew a complex symbol on the floor, a combination of circle, triangle, and square, and then dropped a small amount of water at the center.

Next, she lit candles around the bowl, the flickering flames casting eerie shadows on the walls. She sat opposite the bowl, closed her eyes, and began chanting her spell. Her voice was low and hypnotic, weaving a web of dark magic around her.

As she chanted, a strong wind began to blow in her room, extinguishing the candles and sending the shadows dancing. But Benedicta didn't flinch, her concentration unwavering. She continued to chant, her voice growing louder and more intense.

Finally, she finished her spell and moved closer to the water. She washed her wounded hand into it, her face screwing up in pain. But she didn't stop, her eyes fixed on the water as she continued to chant.

As she did so, a dark, swirling energy began to build up in the water. It was as if the very essence of Benedicta's magic was being distilled into this one, potent spell.

When she was done, Benedicta cut her nail and started muttering another spell. A drop of her blood fell into the water, and she grinned happily. She bring out the container that have Ryder’s blood and smirk. She muttered a few more words, and then, using her power, she moved the blood from the bottleinto the water.

The water began to churn and bubble, and then, in an instant, it changed from clear to red to black. The wound on Benedicta's hand began to glow with an otherworldly energy, and then, like a dark, smoky mist, it left her hand and drifted out of the room.

"Next time, you won't mess with me," Benedicta said, her voice dripping with malice. She looked at her fresh, unblemished arm and sighed in relief. Then, exhausted, she lay down on her bed and fell asleep.

Meanwhile, in the guys' room, everyone was sleeping peacefully. Ryder, Thane, Cassius, and Lucan were all snoring softly, unaware of the danger that was lurking outside.

The dark, smoky mist seeped through the window and entered the room, moving stealthily towards Ryder. It began to enter his right arm, but just as it did, the golden bracelet on his arm began to glow.

Long, golden ropes erupted from the bracelet, tying Ryder's body tightly. The dark magic tried to enter, but it couldn't penetrate the protective barrier of the golden ropes.

The dark magic tried again and again, but it was no use. Finally, it gave up and seeped back out through the window. Ryder and the others continued to sleep peacefully, unaware of the danger that had just passed.

The dark magic seeped back into Benedicta's room through the window. She was still asleep, exhausted from her ritual. The dark magic went back to her hand, and the wound began to glow with an otherworldly energy.

As Benedicta slept, the wound on her hand began to spread, growing bigger and wider. It looked as though something was moving inside the wound, twisting and turning like a living thing. Benedicta continues to sleep not knowing what is going on.
.

.
.
             THE NEXT DAY   

The sweet aroma wafting through the room was what woke Maledicta up. She sat up in bed, rubbing her eyes, and saw Lilith, Belladonna, and Arachne arranging varieties of delicacies on the table.

"What is the occasion?" Maledicta asked, raising her eyebrows.

"Don't know, but I think you did well last night," Belladonna said with a smirk.

Maledicta's face turned bright red. "I did nothing; he was the one doing the whole thing," she muttered.

"What? After what we taught you, you didn't put any of it into practice?"Lilith scoffed.

Arachne stared at them like a confused kitten, unsure of what was going on.

"I did the dance, but not the other one," Maledicta said, trying to defend herself.

Belladonna groaned in disappointment. "That was the fun part among it." She said.

"Maybe another time," Maledicta said, trying to placate them.

Lilith opened her mouth to respond, but stopped when Lucan arrived. They all bowed their heads and quickly left the room, leaving only the two of them.

Lucan walked over to the table and gestured to the food. 

"Eat up; we have somewhere to go." He said.

Maledicta's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Really? Where?" she asked, taking a seat.

"Why don't you wait?" he muttered, taking a seat opposite her.

Maledicta started eating, trying to contain her excitement. Lucan watched her, his eyes never leaving hers.

"Aren't you eating?" she asked after a few minutes, noticing that Lucan hadn't touched his food.

"I am not eating," he said, his eyes still fixed on hers.

"Have a little; I can't eat while you don't," she said, offering him some of her food.

Lucan hesitated for a moment before accepting it. Maledicta smiled happily, feeling like things were finally going in the right direction between them.

She couldn't wait to do the final intimate act, maybe by then, she wouldn't need to stab his heart again.

But her happiness was short-lived, as Lucan suddenly snapped at her.

"Why are you grinning?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

Maledicta quickly wiped the smile off her face. "Nothing," she said, trying to play it cool.

But Lucan just smiled, He watched her for a few more minutes before standing up.

"I'll be back; finish eating," he said, and walked out of the room.

Maledicta let out a sigh of relief, feeling a little overwhelmed by Lucan's intense gaze. She continued eating, trying to calm her nerves.

But just as she was taking a bite, she accidentally stained her lip with food. She groaned in frustration, feeling like a clumsy fool.

And to make matters worse, Lucan walked back into the room, a smirk on his face.

"Are you a kid or what? Why can't you eat without staining your mouth?" he scoffed, shaking his head.

Maledicta's face turned bright red with embarrassment. 

"I'm sorry," she muttered, trying to clean up the stain.

But Lucan just chuckled and walked over to her.
.
.

The students sat under a massive and beautiful tree, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere after breakfast. The warm sun shone down on them, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

"We really get closer here, and somehow, being here didn't feel that bad," Cassius said, breaking the silence.

Thane smiled, nodding in agreement. "Yes, you are all amazing, and I wish we could get even closer." He said.

Lilith's face lit up with a bright smile. "If we want to be close, then we shouldn't keep anything from each other. So, Thane found his mate, and guess what? I am!" She said.

The group erupted into cheers and congratulations.

 "That's the coolest thing the goddess has ever done, making you both mates” Belladonna grinned.

As they laughed and joked, Cassius took Belladonna's hand, pecking it gently, which made her blush.

"Finally, I thought it would never happen!"Thane dramatically scoffed.

Ryder cleared his throat, "I also have something to say. We are betrothed and will soon get married, me and Arachne." He said.

The group's jaws dropped in unison,  "How is that even possible? I thought we no longer do stuff like that” Cassius said.

Ryder's smile grew wider. "When it's possible when I'm the crown prince of this land." He muttered.

The group's eyes widened in shock, "You're joking, right?" Thane asked.

Ryder shook his head. "I'm not. I'm Ryder Edward, the future king of this land." He said.

 "If that's true, does that mean Belladonna is your sister?"Lilith said.

All eyes turned to Belladonna, who looked sheepish. "I wanted to tell you all, but..."

Cassius finished for her, "But what? You don't even act like you're related. I could never have imagined!" He said.

Belladonna pointed at Ryder. "We do talk privately, I'm sorry for keeping it. You should blame him instead; he's the one who wouldn't let people know." She said.

Ryder looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry, guys. I just don't like attention." He said gently.

"Wow, I can't believe I was looking down on you. Should we start calling you 'Your Highness'?" Cassius tease.

Ryder's face turned bright red. 

"Don't you dare! This is part of the reason I didn't want to tell you." He said.

"Did you guys realize we're somehow related now?"Arachne laughed.

"Yeah, we're the future in-laws!"Belladonna grinned.

The group erupted into laughter, with Ryder shaking his head, "You guys are something else." He said.
.
.
.
Maledicta gasped in wonder as she took in the breathtaking view before her. Lucan had brought her to a secluded part of the garden that none of them had ever seen before. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the soft chirping of birds could be heard in the distance.

She stared at the crystal-clear water of the lake, mesmerized by the way the sunlight danced across its surface. The surrounding trees were adorned with vibrant flowers, creating a picturesque scene that seemed almost surreal.

"I dreamed about a certain girl last night," Lucan said, his voice low and husky.

 "We planned to have the most beautiful place ever, a private place for us. And I know that girl is you." He added gently.

Maledicta's eyes met Lucan's, and she felt a flutter in her chest.

 "How are you so sure it's me?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lucan's eyes seemed to bore into her soul. "Because I saw her face. I think we have some sort of special connection." He said.

"I am glad you are finally having my memory," she said, a smile spreading across her face. "I thought you wouldn't remember me forever."

Lucan's eyes narrowed slightly. "How was I then? When we were together?" He asked.

Maledicta's smile grew wider. "You were the best man I have ever met, my pill." She said.

 "What about this place?" he asked.

Maledicta's gaze swept across the beautiful scenery before her.

 "It's so beautiful. I feel like staying forever." She said.

Lucan's eyes locked onto hers, and he smashed his lips onto hers in a deep, passionate kiss. Maledicta felt her heart soar as she wrapped her arms around him, deepening the kiss.

Meanwhile, Benedicta suddenly woke up, wincing in pain as she sat up in bed. She have never wake up this late before, She was more than shocked to see the wound back on her arm, it has spread to her wrist and shoulder, and her eyes widened in horror as she took in the sight of the maggots crawling across her skin.

She quickly poured a powder onto the wound, hoping to kill off the maggots. But instead of dying, they seemed to multiply, and Benedicta's face twisted in disgust.

The wound had started to smell, giving off a bad, rotten odor that made Benedicta's stomach turn. She quickly sprayed a leaf fragrance onto the wound, trying to cover up the smell.

She wore a long dress to cover up the wound and made her way to the window. As she looked out, she saw the students talking in the garden, and her shock turned to anger when she saw Lucan and Maledicta walking out of the garden.

Maledicta was smiling as she said something to Lucan, and Benedicta's anger boiled over. She knew immediately that her plan had failed, and she couldn't seem to keep Lucan and Maledicta away from each other.

But Benedicta was not one to give up easily. If one way didn't work, another way could. She smiled to herself as she remembered a spell she had come across in her black magic book.

She went to retrieve the book and started flipping through the pages furiously. Her eyes scanned the pages until she came across the spell she was looking for.

"Wiping his memory and making him mad - that's the only option for now," she muttered to herself, a creepy smile spreading across her face.
.
.
.
.

It was a full moon, and the entire coven was tucked away in their rooms. Cassius and Thane had marked their mates, making it clear to everyone that they were taken.

Maledicta stood before Lucan, a seductive smile spreading across her face. She was ready to complete the third intimate act, the final step in their bonding ritual.

"What are you doing?" Lucan asked, his voice low and husky.

Maledicta's smile grew wider. "To make you happy," she whispered, her eyes locked on his.

She kneeled down before him, her hands working to loosen the rope of her trousers. Lucan's eyes watched, mesmerized, as she slowly dropped her trousers and took his d**k in her hand.

Maledicta's smile never wavered as she began to pleasure Lucan. His back jerked off the bed, and he let out a low groan as she took him in her mouth.

Lucan's eyes snapped shut, and he let out a series of low grunts as Maledicta worked her magic. Suddenly, he sat up, lifting Maledicta off the ground and throwing her onto the bed.

He took over, his mouth pleasuring Maledicta as she lay back, her eyes closed in ecstasy. Her mouth was wide open, and she let out a series of low moans as Lucan worked his magic.

Finally, Lucan pushed his d**k into Maledicta, and she let out a low cry of pleasure. He started banging her with everything he had, and Maledicta met his thrusts with equal fervor.

They came together, their bodies shuddering as they reached climax. They lay there, breathing heavily, as the tension between them dissipated.

Maledicta couldn't contain her excitement. The intimate act was complete, and they were finally safe. She smiled up at Lucan, who just stare at her in confusion.

"You are amazing," Lucan whispered, pulling Maledicta into a tight hug, she close her eyes while still smiling.

Meanwhile, Benedicta finished chanting her spell, her voice shaking with exhaustion. She was sweating profusely, and her hands were hurting, but it was all worth it.

The red water in her hand began to bubble and churn, and Benedicta smiled to herself. She knew that her spell would work.

The water flew out of Benedicta's room, soaring through the air until it reached Lucan's room. Maledicta and Lucan were already asleep, exhausted from their earlier activities.

The water dropped onto Lucan's mark on his forehead, and the mark began to glow. For a moment, it seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and then it returned to normal.
.
.
.
.
The noise coming from outside was what woke Maledicta up. She rubbed her eyes, thinking it was just a dream, but the commotion persisted. She got out of bed and went to check through the window. Her eyes widened in horror when she saw her friends tied up and thrown into an iron cage.

She immediately ran outside, her heart racing with fear.

 "What is going on?" she asked, trying to rush to her friends' side, but the guards caught her.

They held her firmly, their grip like a vice. Maledicta struggled to free herself, but it was no use. She looked around frantically.

That's when she saw Lucan standing beside Benedicta, and she shouted his name.

When Lucan turned to face her, Maledicta's blood ran cold. His eyes were red and black, and he looked like a total psychopath. He moved closer to her, his grin growing wider.

"You must be the little wench sent to kill me," he sneered, his voice dripping with malice.

Maledicta's eyes widened in shock. 

"What...what's going on, Lucan? Why are you doing this?" She muttered.

But Lucan just laughed maniacally. "Tie her up. We're going to Nightshade." He said.

The guards started tying Maledicta up, their ropes biting into her skin. She struggled and kicked, but it was no use.

Lucan's eyes gleamed with madness as he looked at her. 

"I'll kill you in front of your people, burn the whole town, and rule the world." He said.

Benedicta smiled, her eyes glinting with malevolence, finally, things are going her way once again.

Maledicta was thrown into the cage, joining the other girls. The boys were in a separate cage at the front, and soon four powerful horses appeared, tied to the cages. The horses started dragging the cages, their speed like lightning, and it was obvious they would reach Nightshade town in no time.

Lucan and Benedicta climbed onto horses, accompanied by the guards, and started their journey to Nightshade. Maledicta watched them go, feeling a mix of emotions: sadness, anger, and fear.

Belladonna broke the silence, "What happened? Didn't anything happen between you two?" She asked.

Maledicta stared out of space, her eyes unfocused. "It did...he changed...we talked...he told me I'm amazing...he even showed me something amazing...I don't know what's wrong," she said sadly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lilith's eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on Benedicta's retreating figure. "Do you think this is Benedicta's handiwork?" she asked, her voice laced with suspicion.

Arachne's face twisted in anger. "I'm sure she has something to do with this. She's always been jealous of Maledicta and Lucan's relationship." She said.

Belladonna's eyes widened in concern. "Can we stop him? He shouldn't hurt our people." She said.

"I'll try to bring him back. I just hope it helps."Maledicta said.

Lilith groaned, frustration etched on her face. "Why is this happening? The book said that if you guys did it three times, your hearts would be connected. So, what went wrong?" She said.

Arachne shook her head. "Let's just protect ourselves first and wish for the safety of our parents. With this speed, we'll soon get to the town. We couldn't even inform them so they could prepare." She said.

Maledicta's hand slipped under her clothes, and she pulled out the dagger. The others watched in surprise as she held it up.

"My mom sent word to me with this dagger," she explained. "Maybe if I stab his heart, he could come back to his senses instead of dying."

Belladonna's eyes widened in fear. "What if he doesn't?"

Maledicta's face set in determination. "Then I'll kill myself because I don't think I can live without him."

The others watched her with pitiful eyes, wishing they could do something to make it all go away. But they were weak and helpless, unable to do anything but watch as the events unfolded.

As the cages continued to move, the girls fell into a somber silence, each lost in their own thoughts. Maledicta's eyes never left the dagger.
.
.
.
.

As the Nightshade city came into view, Lucan let out a smirk, clearly pleased with himself. He urged the horse on, and it galloped into the city, but Lucan's smirk disappeared when he was thrown back heavily.

He jumped down from the horse and moved closer to the city's entrance, where an invisible barrier seemed to be blocking his way. He stretched his hand toward the barrier, but it stopped him.

A psychotic smirk spread across his face. "Wow, I can't believe they made this to keep me out," he sneered.

Benedicta stepped forward, trying to prove herself. She made a red ball with her hand and threw it at the invisible shield, but it bounced back, throwing her away. She managed to stand up, wincing in pain as she clutched her arm.

She felt a wave of intense pain wash over her, and she could feel the maggots crawling in her wound. She felt a sense of disgust and revulsion, but Lucan didn't even spare her a glance.

Instead, he moved closer to the barrier and started pushing his hand into it. His hand changed to fire, and he started burning the shield. He kept pushing forward, his flames burning brighter and hotter.

But just as it seemed like he was about to break through, a force suddenly threw him off. He stumbled back, laughing loudly.

"Wow, they must be stronger than I thought," he said, clearly impressed.

He strengthened his hand, and a large sword appeared in his hand immediately. 

"Long time, no see," he muttered, kissing the sharp, glowing blade.

He moved closer to the shield and struck it three times with the sword. There was a strong flash of lightning, and the shield vanished. Lucan climbed back onto his horse and entered the city with the others.

The guards of the city quickly came out and surrounded them, their swords drawn. They looked afraid, but they stood their ground.

"I guess they're not as dumb as I thought," Lucan said, smirking.

The king of Nightshade stepped forward, flanked by Alpha Ray and Beta. 

"Lucan, please leave our land now, and we will live in harmony, minding our own business. We won't do anything to anger you." The king said gently.

Lucan sneered. "You think I'll just leave after I've prepared myself so much? That wouldn't happen. But we could make a deal, though. How about a fight with her?" He muttered.

He nodded to his guard, who dragged Maledicta out of the cage. The others screamed and protested, but Lucan just smiled.

"Never," Mistress Morwen screamed.

Lucan raised an eyebrow. "What? Are you looking down on her? She was born for a purpose, right? To kill. You can't look down on your supposed savior. So, are you in or out?" He asked.

Maledicta stepped forward, her eyes flashing with determination. 

"I'm in." She muttered.

Lucan's grin grew wider as he glared at her. 

"Well, let's get started. And no one should try to act smart, or you'll all be dead." He said.

The guards and the people of Nightshade started making space for the fight, their faces filled with fear and anticipation. Lucan and Maledicta stood facing each other, their eyes locked in a fierce stare.

Maledicta brought out her sword, her hand shaking slightly as she faced Lucan. She searched his face for any emotions, but it was blank, devoid of any feeling. He charged towards her like a flash, and she quickly moved away, her heart beating loudly.

"Zoning out wouldn't help," he muttered, swinging his sword like a psycho. The others could barely watch, frozen in fear.

"Kaiden!" Maledicta called out when he charged again. She quickly raised her sword, and their blades clashed, causing a strong wind that sent Maledicta flying back a little.

"So weak," Lucan muttered, striking her quickly, but Maledicta kept blocking his sword. She was getting tired, her breath coming in ragged gasps, but she refused to give up.

Lucan wanted to stab her with the sword on the ground, but she quickly rolled away. The others breathed a sigh of relief, their fear momentarily alleviated.

Maledicta moved back a little, creating some distance between herself and Lucan. She made a ball of energy and threw it at him, hitting him squarely. 

"Come to your senses, Kaiden!" she yelled.

But Lucan just smirked, creating a massive black fireball. It was enormous, and Benedicta watched with a satisfied smile on her face.

Maledicta wanted to run, but the fireball was too fast. It approached her with alarming speed, and she yelled "Kaiden!" with everything in her before the fire engulfed her chest and sent her flying over.

Lucan grabbed his head, starting to groan in pain. His eyes suddenly returned to their normal color, and he looked towards Maledicta, who was trying to stand up while vomiting blood.

"Male!" he yelled, running to catch her as she fell again.

 "I am so sorry; please forgive me," he begged, tears streaming down his face as he remembered everything he had done.

Maledicta managed to say "I...am...sorry too" before stabbing him in the chest with the golden dagger. Lucan's eyes widened in shock, and he fell to the ground beside her.

He grunted and groaned in pain, his body twitching until he finally stopped moving. All his guards, horses, and cages disappeared, including the ropes that bound the others.

Maledicta crawled closer to Lucan's limp body, calling out his name, but he didn't budge. She yelled his name, crying hotly when nothing happened.

"Why isn't he standing up?" she asked, tears streaming down her face.

The others watched, unsure of what to say. Then, like a flash, someone stabbed Maledicta from behind, the sword coming out from the front.

"Finally," Benedicta muttered with a smirk, but she was immediately attacked from every angle. Fireballs of all sorts were sent her way by the students.

She fell to the ground, unable to move. Mistress Morwen and the others rushed towards Maledicta, who was pouring out blood from her nose, mouth, and ears.

"I am so sorry, daughter," Mistress Morwen cried, not knowing what to do. They couldn't even remove the sword, and Maledicta was already too weak to heal herself.

"If...he...wakes...up, tell him...to...wait...for...me, don't...hurt...him," Maledicta managed to say before going limp.

The others started crying immediately. Lucan coughed and opened his eyes, which widened as he saw Maledicta's body. He ran to her side, shaking her and telling her to stand up, but she was long gone.

"This is my fault; I was the one who was supposed to die," he said, crying profusely. The others watched sadly, unsure of what to say.

As they stood there, mourning the loss of Maledicta, Lucan's eyes never left her body. He was feeling so much regret.

             FEW DAYS LATER

The whole town gathered at the altar, their faces somber and grief-stricken. Maledicta's body lay on the altar, dressed in a beautiful white gown, adorned with intricate lace and delicate flowers. A flower crown rested on her head, and her hair was styled in soft, flowing waves.

The students stood at the front of the crowd, their eyes puffy and red from non-stop tears. Kaiden, in particular, looked like a living dead man. His eyes were sunken, his skin pale, and his face gaunt. He seemed to have aged decades in just a few days.

As the ritual began, the townspeople sang a haunting melody, their voices echoing through the air. The students joined in, their voices cracking with emotion. Kaiden, however, remained silent, his eyes fixed on Maledicta's lifeless body.

After the ritual, Maledicta's body was placed in a beautiful black coffin, adorned with intricate carvings and symbols. The coffin was carried to the ocean, where it was placed on the water. The waves gently carried the coffin away, as the townspeople watched in silence.

As the coffin disappeared into the distance, the townspeople turned to Kaiden. They looked at him with a mixture of anger and disgust. No one wanted him in their city, not after what he had done.

"You're not welcome here," one of the townspeople spat. "You're going back to where you came from."

Kaiden didn't resist as the townspeople dragged him away. He was no longer powerful, no longer a threat. He was just an ordinary human, stripped of his magic and his pride. The others couldn't help and just watch silently.

As for Benedicta, she remained on the spot where she had fallen that day. She couldn't move, couldn't speak. The wound had spread all over her body, and maggots crawled inside the rotting flesh. The smell was overpowering, and the townspeople had to spray fragrance around her to prevent the foul, rotten smell from spreading.

No one helped Benedicta, no one showed her any mercy. She was left to suffer in secret, her body slowly decaying as the maggots ate away at her flesh. It was a slow, agonizing death, and Benedicta was powerless to stop it.

As the days passed, Benedicta's body began to weaken. Her skin turned gray, her eyes sunken. She was barely recognizable, barely human. And yet, she still clung to life, her mind trapped in a prison of pain and suffering.

It was a fate worse than death, and Benedicta knew it. She was trapped, unable to escape, unable to die. And as the maggots continued to eat away at her flesh, Benedicta knew that she would never be free.

             A YEAR LATER 

           (THE FUTURE)  

A year had passed since Maledicta's death. she was gone forever, and the pain of her loss had left a gaping hole in his heart.

But Kaiden had not let his grief consume him. Instead, he had thrown himself into his work, building his company into the biggest and most successful in the state.

As he walked into his office building, the workers greeted him with a chorus of 

"Good morning, sir!" Kaiden nodded curtly, not bothering to respond. He was a man consumed by his own thoughts, and he didn't have time for pleasantries.

He made his way to his office, a sprawling space with a stunning view of the city. But Kaiden didn't notice the view. He was too busy thinking about Maledicta.

He sat down at his desk and let out a sad sigh. Despite all his success, he was never happy without Maledicta by his side. He missed her laughter, her smile, and her sparkling eyes.

He missed Nightshade City too, and all the friends he had made there. Kaiden's heart ached with longing as he thought about the life he had left behind.

Just then, his secretary burst into the room, breaking the spell of Kaiden's reverie. 

"A lady is here to see you, sir. Should I let her in?" He asked.

Kaiden muttered a distracted "Yes," not even looking up from his desk. He was too lost in his thoughts to care about whoever was visiting him.

But as the lady entered the room, Kaiden's head snapped up, and he felt like he had been punched in the gut. Standing before him was Maledicta, looking more beautiful than he had ever seen her.

Her white hair was styled in loose waves, and her eyes sparkled like diamonds in the morning light. She was wearing a stunning red dress that hugged her curves in all the right places.

Kaiden's eyes widened in shock as he stared at Maledicta. He couldn't believe she was standing in front of him, alive and well.

He sprang out of his chair, his heart racing with excitement.

 "Maledicta!" he exclaimed, rushing to her side.

He swept her into his arms, holding her tightly as tears of joy streamed down his face.

 "I thought I'd never see you again," he whispered, his voice shaking with emotion.

Maledicta smiled up at him, her eyes shining with happiness. "I said I'd be back, didn't I?" she teased.

Kaiden laughed, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. 

"I should have trusted you," he said, holding her closer.

Maledicta leaned into him, her lips brushing against his ear. 

"You look handsome, Kaiden," she whispered.

Kaiden's heart skipped a beat as he felt a rush of desire. He pulled back, gazing into Maledicta's eyes.

 "You look beautiful, my love," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

Maledicta chuckled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. 

"Nightshade City said you're invited to visit and live there," she said, her voice filled with excitement.

Kaiden's face lit up with joy. "Then what are we waiting for? We should go! I miss everyone!" he exclaimed.

Maledicta smiled, her eyes shining with happiness. 

"Won't you show me around here first?" she asked, her voice filled with curiosity.

Kaiden grinned, feeling a sense of excitement. "Of course, I'll give you the grand tour," he said, taking her hand in his.

As they walked through the office building, Kaiden couldn't help but feel grateful. He had thought he'd lost Maledicta forever, but here she was, back in his life.

He stopped in front of a window, gazing out at the city below. 

"I've missed you so much, Maledicta," he said.

Maledicta leaned into him, her head on his shoulder. 

"I've missed you too, Kaiden," she whispered.

Kaiden turned to her, his eyes locking onto hers. 

"I love you, Maledicta," he said, his voice filled with conviction.

Maledicta smiled, her eyes shining with happiness. "I know, Kaiden. I love you too."

As they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, Kaiden knew that he would never let Maledicta go again. She was his soulmate, his everything.

And as they sealed their love with a passionate kiss, Kaiden knew that he had finally found his happily ever after.

THE END…..

              EPILOGUE

         FIVE YEARS LATER

A shimmering portal opened at the gate of Nightshade City, and Maledicta and Kaiden stepped out, hand in hand, with their four-year-old daughter, Madden, skipping alongside them. Madden's long, white hair cascaded down her back like a river of moonlight, and her bright blue eyes sparkled with excitement.

The city was bustling with activity, as it was the time of the annual Goddess Festival. Colorful streamers and lanterns adorned the streets, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.

Maledicta, Kaiden, and Madden made their way through the crowded streets, greeting familiar faces and exchanging warm hugs. They eventually arrived at their home, where Mistress Morwen was waiting with open arms.

"Maledicta, Kaiden, it's so wonderful to see you both!" Mistress Morwen exclaimed, beaming with joy. "And Madden, you're growing up to be just as beautiful as your mother!"

As they entered the house, the whole city seemed to come alive with excitement. People cheered and clapped, and children chased each other through the streets, laughing and playing.

Kaiden, once an outsider, was now fully accepted by the people of Nightshade City. They welcomed him with open arms, and he was greeted with warm smiles and hearty handshakes.

As they made their way through the city, they met up with old friends and classmates. Ryder, the future king, was beaming with pride as he showed off his heavily pregnant wife, Arachne. Belladonna and Cassius were delighted to introduce their rambunctious toddler son, while Thane and Lilith proudly displayed their twin boys, who were the spitting image of their father.

The group chatted and laughed as they made their way toward the lake, where the final program of the Goddess Festival was about to begin. The atmosphere was electric, filled with music, laughter, and the promise of new beginnings.
